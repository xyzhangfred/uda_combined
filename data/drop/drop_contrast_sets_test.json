        "passage": "Urged by influential Jesuit priests who had come to Brazil with Mem de S\u00e1, named Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and Manuel da N\u00f3brega, and who had played a big role in pacifying the Tamoios, Mem de S\u00e1 ordered his nephew, Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 to assemble a new attack force. Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on March 1, 1565, and fought the Frenchmen for two more years. Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his uncle, on January 20, 1567, he imposed final defeat on the French forces and decisively expelled them from Brazil, but died a month later from wounds inflicted in the battle. Coligny's and Villegaignon's dream had lasted a mere 12 years. Largely in response to the two attempts of France to conquer territory in Brazil , between 1612 and 1615, the Portuguese crown decided to expand its colonization efforts in Brazil. Prior to this in 1560, Mem de S\u00e1, the new Governor-General of Brazil, received from the Portuguese government the command to expel the French. With a fleet of 26 warships and 2,000 soldiers, on 15 March 1560, he attacked and destroyed Fort Coligny within three days, but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and defenders, because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Native Brazilians, where they continued to live and to work. Admiral Villegaignon had returned to France in 1558, disgusted with the religious tension that existed between French Protestants and Catholics, who had come also with the second group.",

        "passage": "The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced back to the Soviet war in Afghanistan . The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China supported the Islamist Afghan mujahadeen guerillas against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A small number of \"Afghan Arab\" volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including Osama bin Laden, but there is no evidence they received any external assistance. In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders , sponsored by bin Laden , started forming a large base of operations in Afghanistan, where the Islamist extremist regime of the Taliban had seized power earlier in the year. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden signed a fatw\u0101, as head of al-Qaeda, declaring war on the West and Israel. Earlier in August 1996, Bin Laden declared jihad against the United States. Later in May 1998 al-Qaeda released a video declaring war on the U.S. and the West. On 7 August 1998, al-Qaeda struck the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, U.S. President Bill Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach, a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan against targets the U.S. asserted were associated with WIFJAJC, although others have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was used as a chemical warfare facility. The plant produced much of the region's antimalarial drugs and around 50% of Sudan's pharmaceutical needs. The strikes failed to kill any leaders of WIFJAJC or the Taliban. Next came the 2000 millennium attack plots, which included an attempted bombing of Los Angeles International Airport. On 12 October 2000, the USS Cole bombing occurred near the port of Yemen, and 17 U.S. Navy sailors were killed.",

Of those, 232 species  are found in mangroves and 149 species  reside in seagrass; so 101 species are common to both habitats. The sea also hosts many vulnerable fauna species, including dugong , several dolphin species, such as Irrawaddy Dolphin  and certain species of sea turtles: critically endangered leatherback turtle  and hawksbill turtle  and threatened green turtle  and Olive Ridley turtle . There are only about 150 dugongs in the Andaman Sea, scattered between Ranong and Satun Provinces. These species are sensitive to the degradation of seagrass meadows. Coral reefs are estimated to occupy 73,364 rai in the Andaman Sea with only 6.4 percent in ideal condition.",

She was the eldest daughter of Sir John Webb, 3rd baronet, of Odstock, Wiltshire, and Barbara, daughter and coheiress of John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. Their only son John Radclyffe, titular 4th Earl of Derwentwater  succeeded. John is generally accepted to have died at the age of 19 after a cutting for the stone. In the mid 19th century a woman claiming to be his great granddaughter and referring to herself as the Countess of Derwentwater made claim upon the Derwentwater estates, but was eventually discredited. She claimed that John had not died in 1731 but had fled to Germany to avoid an attempt on his life by the Hanoverian government. They also had a daughter, Lady Mary Radclyffe , who married Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre. Lady Derwentwater and her children fled to Brussels in 1721, and she died there of smallpox in 1723.",

        "passage": "Both the business community and local Republicans wanted to weaken unions, which played a major role in funding and campaigning for Democratic candidates.  The strategy of the Eisenhower administration was to consolidate the anti-union potential inherent in the Taft-Hartley Act.  Pressure from the Justice Department, the Labor Department, and especially from congressional investigations focused on criminal activity and racketeering in high-profile labor unions, especially the Teamsters Union.  Republicans wanted to delegitimize unions by focusing on their shady activities. The McClellan Committee hearings targeted Teamsters president James R. Hoffa as a public enemy. Young Robert Kennedy played a major role working for the committee. Public opinion polls showed growing distrust toward unions, and especially union leaders\u2014or \"labor bosses,\" as Republicans called them. The bipartisan Conservative Coalition, With the aid of liberals such as the Kennedy brothers, won new Congressional restrictions on organized labor in the form of the Landrum-Griffin Act . The main impact was to force more democracy on the previously authoritarian union hierarchies. However, in the 1958 elections, taking place during a sharp economic recession, the unions fought back especially against state Right to Work laws and defeated many conservative Republicans. The Teamsters union was expelled from the AFL for its notorious corruption under president Dave Beck. Its troubles gained national attention from highly visible Senate hearings. The target was Jimmy Hoffa, who was imprisoned in 1964. Earlier Hoffa has replaced Beck in 1957 and held total power. All this started since the labor unions were a whole high-profile target of Republican activists throughout the 1940s and 1950s. It alse lead to the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.",

The Raiders continued to trail as QB Philip Rivers completed an 8-yard TD pass to RB Darren Sproles and a 59-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson, while Kaeding got a 39-yard field goal. RB Darren Sproles also made a 6-yard TD pass back to Philip Rivers. Oakland responded with CB Justin Miller returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown.  After a scoreless third quarter, San Diego pulled away in the fourth quarter as Rivers hooked up with Sproles again on an 18-yard TD pass.

Bentley recovered only half on the \u20a4150 he advanced Melville, whose share from actual sales would have been just \u20a438, and he did not print a new edition. Harpers first printing was 2,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. The selling price was $1.50, about a fifth of the price of the British three-volume edition. About 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year. After three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in December 1853. In 1855, a second printing of 250 copies was issued, in 1863, a third of 253 copies, and finally in 1871, a fourth printing of 277 copies, which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered. Moby-Dick was out of print during the last four years of Melvilles life, having sold 2,300 in its first year and a half and on average 27 copies a year for the next 34 years, totaling 3,215 copies.",

Two days later they reached Carlisle, where the castle defences were in poor condition and manned only by 80 elderly veterans. The garrison surrendered on 15 November after learning Wade could not relieve them in time and the Jacobites marched south, leaving a small garrison of their own in place. On 26 November, they reached Preston, site of a major battle in 1715, followed by Manchester on the 28th November, where the first significant intake of 200-300 English recruits was formed into the Manchester Regiment. The army entered Derby on 4 December and the Council met the following day to discuss the next steps.",

        "passage": "Although fighting in Pontiac's Rebellion began in 1763, rumors reached British officials as early as 1761 that discontented Native Americans were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country circulated messages in 1761 which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. The Mingos, led by Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris, were concerned about being surrounded by British forts. Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country. The Native Americans were not unified, however, and in June 1761, Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot. After William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1762 a tenuous peace was maintained, but war belts continued to circulate. Violence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 of the imminent French cession of the pays d'en haut to the British.",

        "passage": "On 31 January 1919, because of the pressure from the Triple Entente representatives, the attack on Skocz\u00f3w was cancelled, and the Czechoslovak army ceased fighting. The Czechoslovak army withdrew to the new Green Line, established by the International Commission Agreement on the basis of the Czechoslovak-Polish Treaty, concluded on 3 February 1919 in Paris. On 30 January 1919 Josef \u0160nejd\u00e1rek had received the order to cross the Vistula and secure the railway line between Bohum\u00edn and Jablunkov. They crossed the river and the Polish troops retreated to Skocz\u00f3w, where the front line was stalled. Further Czechoslovak reinforcements arrived, which gave \u0160nejd\u00e1rek an advantage over the Polish units. The Czechoslovak army prepared for an attack on Skocz\u00f3w assuming that it would lead to the collapse of the Polish defenses. Earlier, Cieszyn Silesia was occupied without a fight on 27 January 1919. All this had started on 23 January 1919 at 11:00 in Cieszyn Silesia when Polish commander Franciszek Latinik and Czechoslovak officer Josef \u0160nejd\u00e1rek met with a group of officers, consisting of English, French, Italian and U.S. representatives . The Polish side was given an ultimatum, that they evacuate the area to the Bia\u0142a River in less than two hours. After the expiry of this period the Czechoslovak army started its operations at 13:00 following its operational guidelines to seize Bohum\u00edn and Karvin\u00e1. From the east, at the same time, an attack was launched by the Italian legionnaire unit. The Czechoslovak army moved forward, and took Bohum\u00edn , Orlov\u00e1 and Karvin\u00e1.  Polish troops retreated to the river Vistula.",

        "passage": "The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki during 1783-1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. This was after the first census carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358.  Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century; from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate Replacement fertility rate.",

Union growth in 2017 was primarily millennial workers. For instance, about 76 percent of new UAW union members during their increase came from workers under the age of 35. Although the total number of union members increased 1.7 percent in 2017, the Economic Policy Institute noted that year-to-year union membership often fluctuates due to hiring or layoffs in particular sectors, and cautioned against interpreting one-year changes as trends. The percentage of the workforce belonging to unions was 10.7 percent in 2017, unchanged over the previous year, but down from 11.1 percent in 2015, and 12.1 percent in 2007.",

The census included German soldiers stationed in the area as well as public officials sent to administer the area. Since 1886, a Prussian Settlement Commission was set up by Prussia to enforce German settlement while at the same time Poles, Jews and Germans migrated west during the Ostflucht. In 1921 the proportion of Germans in Pomerania (where the Corridor was located) was 18.8% (175,771). Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9.6%. There was also a Jewish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500. After the occupation by Nazi Germany, a census was made by the German authorities in December 1939. 71% of people declared themselves as Poles, 188,000 people declared Kashubian as their language, 100,000 of those declared themselves Polish.",

Afterwards, the Ravens took the lead with QB Kyle Boller completing a 8-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason.  In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead with kicker Matt Stover getting a 29-yard field goal.  Later, New England tied the game prior to halftime as FB Heath Evans got a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Ravens regained the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 17-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Patriots would tie the game with QB Tom Brady completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore took the lead again as Boller completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Wilcox.  Afterwards, New England drew closer with Gostkowski making a 38-yard field goal.  The Patriots retook the lead with Brady completing an 1-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney.  Boller's hail-mary TD pass was completed to WR Mark Clayton at New England's 2-yard line; he was tackled as time expired. With the loss, the Ravens fell to 4-8 thus eliminating themselves from the playoff contentions.",

        "passage": " Coming off their Monday night win over the Falcons, the Saints stayed at home for a Week 9 NFC South duel with the Carolina Panthers. New Orleans would trail in the first quarter as Panthers running back DeAngelo Williams got a 66-yard and a 7-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, the Saints got on the board with a 23-yard field goal from kicker John Carney. Carolina would reply with kicker John Kasay getting a 32-yard field goal, yet New Orleans would close out the half with Carney's 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints crept closer with a 10-yard touchdown by running back Pierre Thomas. The Panthers would reply with Kasay nailing a 25-yard field goal, yet New Orleans would close out the period with quarterback Drew Brees' 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem. Afterwards, the Saints took command in the fourth quarter as Carney booted a 40-yard field goal, followed by defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove forcing Williams into a fumble and recovering it for a 1-yard touchdown run. With the win, the Saints improved to 8-0, which is the team's best start in franchise history.",

Leopold had also been offended by Richard casting down his standard from the walls of Acre in 1191. He was later transferred to the custody of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and it took a ransom of one hundred and fifty thousand marks to obtain his release. Richard returned to England in 1194 and died of a crossbow bolt wound in 1199 at the age of 41. Henry of Champagne was killed in an accidental fall in 1197. In 1193, Saladin died of yellow fever. His heirs would quarrel over the succession and ultimately fragment his conquests. Queen Isabella then married for a fourth time, to Amalric of Lusignan, who had succeeded his brother Guy, positioned as King of Cyprus. After their deaths in 1205, her eldest daughter Maria of Montferrat  succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem. Richard's decision not to attack Jerusalem would lead to the call for a Fourth Crusade six years after the third ended in 1192. However, Richard's victories facilitated the survival of a wealthy Crusader kingdom centred on Acre. Historian Thomas F. Madden summarises the achievements of the Third Crusade:",

In the first quarter, the Rams trailed early as Cardinals RB Marcel Shipp got a 1-yard TD run.  St. Louis responded with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 29-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Rams continued to struggle as QB Matt Leinart completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald, while kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 23-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, St. Louis tried to retaliate with QB Marc Bulger completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt, yet the Cards responded with Shipp's 6-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Rams had Wilkins kick a 37-yard field goal.  However, the Big Red pulled away with Shipp's 29-yard TD run and Rackers' 20-yard TD run.  Even though St. Louis made another TD, with Bulger completing a 1-yard pass to WR Isaac Bruce, Arizona held on to win.  With the loss, the Rams fell to 5-7.",

The Rams took an early lead when Greg Zuerlein kicked a 48-yard field goal, the only scoring drive of the first quarter. The Lions responded in the second quarter when Joique Bell ran in a touchdown from 1 yard out. St. Louis made it a 1-point game when Greg Zuerlein kicked a 29-yard field goal, and took the lead again when Cortland Finnegan intercepted a Kevin Smith pass and ran it back 31 yards for a touchdown. The final points of the half were scored when Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 41-yard field goal. The only points of the third quarter was a 45-yard field goal by Jason Hanson to tie the game. In the  final quarter, the score continued to sea-saw. First the Rams' Brandon Gibson caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Sam Bradford to take the lead back again, but the Lions soon tied it back up when Kevin Smith ran in a touchdown from 5 yards out. The Rams then went up by 3 points when kicked Greg Zuerlein his third field goal of the game, this one from 46 yards out. In the final 2 minutes, the Lions completed their third 80-yard scoring drive with a game-winning 5-yard touchdown catch by Kevin Smith, his second of the game. Greg Zuerlein's third field was the last of the game. The Lions were able to start 1-0 and capture their second straight regular season opening win.",

        "passage": " After forcing a three-and-out, the Jets marched 41 yards to the Patriots 33, finishing the drive with a 51-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On the Patriots third possession of the game, Gronk came off to the sideline injured. He would go to the locker room and wouldn't play another game that season. Later in the first quarter, the Jets marched 79 yards, converting a 3rd-and-9, with Ryan Fitzpatrick finding Brandon Marshall for a 1-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the second quarter, increasing the lead to 10-0. The Patriots responded on their next drive, reaching the Jets 8, but after a 2-yard sack and an incompletion, Gostkowski kicked a 28-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 10-3. On the second play of the Jets ensuing possession, Fitzpatrick connected with Robby Anderson for a 25-yard gain, but Anderson was stripped by Malcolm Butler, who recovered at midfield. The Patriots drove 50 yards, only facing one third-down, and scored on a 4-yard touchdown catch by Malcolm Mitchell. The Jets drove to the Patriots 36 on their next drive, but Folk missed a 54-yard field goal attempt. With great field position at their own 46, the Patriots drove 33 yards to the Jets 21, but Gostkowski missed a 39-yarder, sending the game to halftime tied 10-10. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots marched all the way to the Jets 11, but the Jets clamped down and forced a 29-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving the Patriots their first lead, 13-10. After swapping punts, the Jets covered 73 yards, not facing a single third down, regaining the lead with Fitzpatrick throwing a 22-yard pass to Quincy Enunwa with 10:17 remaining in the fourth quarter. Down 17-13, the Patriots advanced to the Jets 22, but decided to kick a 40-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 17-16. The Jets reached their own 27, but an intentional grounding penalty pushed them back, and they punted two plays later. A holding penalty on McCourty negated Amendola's 15-yard return which would've set the Patriots up at their own 42. Starting at their own 17, Brady led a clutch, 9 play, 83-yard drive. Facing a 4th-and-4 at the Jets 37, Brady completed three consecutive passes: a 4-yard completion to White, a 25-yard completion to Hogan, and then an 8-yard touchdown pass to Mitchell, with a missed two-point conversion, giving the Patriots a 22-17 lead with just 1:56 remaining. After a five-yard completion to Jalin Marshall, Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Long with Trey Flowers recovering at the Jets 34. A 3-yard run by Blount on 3rd-and-2 sealed the win for the Patriots. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2 and clinched their 16th consecutive winning season. This was also the Patriots' 500th franchise win, as well as Tom Brady's 200th career win, tying him with Peyton Manning and surpassing Brett Favre, who had 199 wins. In addition to this, Tom Brady also surpassed the 60,000-yard career passing mark.",

Green Bay would trail in the first quarter as wide receiver Jordy Nelson fumbled on the game's opening kickoff, which allowed Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford to find wide receiver Calvin Johnson.  The Packers would answer in the second quarter as quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Donald Lee, followed by kicker Mason Crosby booting a 20-yard and a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Green Bay would add onto their lead as Rodgers hooked up with wide receiver James Jones on a 21-yard touchdown pass, followed by wide receiver Donald Driver on a 9-yard touchdown pass. Detroit tried to come back in the fourth quarter as safety Louis Delmas tackled running back Ryan Grant in his own endzone for a safety, followed by kicker Jason Hanson nailing a 28-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Packers would pull away as cornerback Charles Woodson returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown. Donald Driver was named Fox's winner of the 2009 Galloping Gobbler Award.",

In the first quarter, the Vikings drew first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Minnesota got into a tiny hole, as Bills RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run. Longwell would give the Vikings a 49-yard field goal as time ran out of the first half, but in the third quarter, the Vikes found themselves in a bit of a hole, as Buffalo QB J. P. Losman connected with WR Peerless Price on an 8-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota trailed even further, as Bills kicker Rian Lindell got a 28-yard field goal. The Vikings would try and comeback, as QB Brad Johnson completed a 29-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. The two-point conversion failed and during their next drive, they ran out of time. With their loss, the Vikings fell to 2-2.",

After a scoreless first quarter, San Diego struck first with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 27-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Ravens took the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 1-yard TD run.  Fortunately, the Chargers regained the lead with QB Philip Rivers completing a 35-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates (with a failed PAT), Kaeding kicking a 46-yard field goal, Rivers completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, and Kaeding kicking a 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Diego increased its lead with Rivers and Gates hooking up with each other again on a 25-yard TD pass.  Baltimore would manage to one final score as Ravens QB Kyle Boller completed a 13-yard TD pass to FB Le'Ron McClain.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the 'Bolts sealed the win with Kaeding nailing a 41-yard field goal. RB LaDainian Tomlinson (24 carries for 77 yards) became the fourth-fastest player and the 23rd player in NFL history to get 10,000 career rushing yards.",

In the first quarter the Vikings took the lead with QB Brett Favre throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Percy Harvin. However, they failed to maintain this lead after kickier Robbie Gould made a 29-yard field goal. In the second quarter this was followed by QB Jay Cutler completing a 67 and a 15-yard TD pass to wide receivers Johnny Knox and Devin Hester respectively, then with Gould nailing a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, The Vikings caused more problems after a three-and-out converted into a 64-yard punt return for a touchdown by Hester. They tried to break the lead with QB Joe Webb scrambling 13 yards for a touchdown, but they continued to struggle after Cutler got a 9-yard TD pass to WR Rashied Davis. This was followed in the fourth quarter by Gould hitting a 34 and a 20-yard field goal. The loss dropped the Vikings to 5-9, securing them their first losing season since 2006.",

The events began with a coup by the Persian Cossack Brigade headed by Reza Khan, and directed by the British, on 21 February 1921. With this coup Zia'eddin Tabatabaee took over power and became Prime Minister. The coup was largely bloodless and faced little resistance. With his expanded forces and the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan launched successful military actions to eliminate separatist and dissident movements in Tabriz, Mashhad and the Janglis in Gilan. The campaign against Simko and the Kurds was less successful and lasted well into 1922, though eventually concluding with Persian success.",

In the first quarter, Denver drew first blood as rookie FB Peyton Hillis got a 7-yard TD run.  The Falcons answered with former Broncos kicker Jason Elam getting a 46-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Atlanta took the lead as Elam made a 36-yard field goal, while RB Michael Turner got a 9-yard TD run. This is still Matt Ryan's only loss at the Georgia Dome to date. In the third quarter, Denver regained the lead as Hillis got a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos increased their lead as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 20-yard field goal.  The Falcons tried to rally as Turner got a 28-yard TD run, yet Denver replied as QB Jay Cutler completed a 9-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham. On a side note, rookie FB Spencer Larsen became the first player in franchise history to start on offense and defense.  In addition to his fullback duties, he also started as middle linebacker, along with his special teams responsibilities.",

        "passage": "On 14 March 1744, two treaties were concluded on economic matters. Prussia mainly relied on its right to take over if the Cirksena family failed to produce a male heir, which had been granted to Prussia by Emperor Leopold I in 1694. Despite objections from the Kingdom of Hanover, King Frederick II of Prussia annexed East Frisia in 1744, after the last Cirksena prince died. Earlier, after the Appeal war, the city of Emden found itself politically isolated and economically weakened. It aimed to regain its position as the county seat and commercial center and in 1740, Emden decided to seek Prussian assistance to achieve this goal. The city wanted to protect its economic position and sought Prussian acknowledgement of its existing privileges. In return, the Estates would recognize Prussia's right to annex the county. The Appeal war had a significant impact on the subsequent history of East Frisia and the annexation by Prussia a few years later. The poor negotiating skills of Enno Rudolph Brenneysen, Prince George Albert's chancellor, prevented a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Although the Prince and his chancellor demanded that the renitents be punished severely, the Emperor pardoned the rebels in 1732. George Albert died on 11 June 1734 and his son Charles Edzard inherited the principality. However, Charles Edzard also found himself unable to resolve the conflict. Around this time, East Frisia began to prepare for the Prussian annexation.",

The lords were assisted by the Kingdom of Scotland and France. On 14\u00a0June 1216, Louis captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of the English kingdom. BUt, after his naval forces were defeated off the coast of Sandwich on 24 August 1217 and his army was beaten at Lincoln on 20 May 1217, Louis was forced to make peace on English terms. All this had started when it seemed that England was his, King John's death in October 1216 caused many of the rebellious barons to desert Louis in favour of John's nine-year-old son, Henry III. With William Marshall acting as regent, a call for the English \"to defend our land\" against the French led to a reversal of fortunes on the battlefield. After Louis's defeat, the principal provisions of the Treaty of Lambeth were an amnesty for English rebels, Louis to undertake not to attack England again, and 10,000\u00a0marks to be given to Louis. The effect of the treaty was that Louis agreed he had never been the legitimate King of England.",

        "passage": " Coming off yet another close win, this time over the Falcons, the Saints went home for a Week 15 Saturday night duel with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Dallas would get off to a fast start with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 49-yard TD pass to wide receiver Miles Austin. The Cowboys then increased their lead later in the quarter with a 3-yard TD run by running back Marion Barber. In the second quarter, the Saints would score their only points of the half with kicker Garrett Hartley nailing a 34-yard field goal. However, the Cowboys took a 17-3 lead at halftime with kicker Nick Folk's 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas scored the period's only points when running back Marion Barber got a 2-yard TD run. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. New Orleans got the first score of the period when running back Mike Bell scored a one yard TD run to make a 24-10 Dallas lead. Following a Dallas three-and-out, New Orleans made it a one touchdown game when quarterback Drew Brees hit wide receiver Lance Moore for a 7-yard TD pass. Dallas then marched down the field to the Saints' eight-yard line, but then kicker Nick Folk's game-icing 23-yard field goal hit the mark. However, unlike in such games against Washington and Atlanta, quarterback Drew Brees was sacked with 10 seconds left in the contest at the Dallas 48-yard line, forcing a fumble for the second time in the game by Dallas' DeMarcus Ware, which was then recovered by nose tackle Jay Ratliff. The Cowboys then took a knee to end the game. With the loss, the Saints fell to 13-1, ending their chance at a perfect season. Also with the Colts' win, the Saints held the 2nd best overall record of any team.",

        "passage": "After the Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1932, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. The Lithuanian National Revival emerged during the 19th century and the movement to establish an independent nation-state intensified during the early 20th century. On November 11, 1918 Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. Earlier on February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the re-establishment of independence from all previous legal bonds with other states. Lithuanian territory was occupied by Germany during World War I from 1915 until the war ended in January 1918. The declaration asserted the right to self-determination, meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. The publication of the Act of Independence was initially suppressed by the German occupation forces, but on March 23, 1918, the Germans acknowledged the declaration; their plans had shifted to the establishment of a network of satellite countries. However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, police force, or civic institutions. The first national government, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, was formed. Voldemaras issued a declaration that Lithuania did not need a military force, as it was not planning to engage in warfare, and that only a small militia was needed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted.",

The Browns would get on the board with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 37-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cleveland started to rebound as QB Derek Anderson completed a 5-yard TD pass to RB Jamal Lewis for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Arizona responded with Warner completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson. The Browns would reply with Anderson completing a 67-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals increased their lead with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 33-yard field goal. Afterwards, Dawson gave Cleveland a 22-yard field goal, yet Arizona answered with Rackers completing a 19-yard field goal. At the end of the game, the Browns had one final chance to win it all. Winslow caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Anderson in the corner of the endzone just beyond the goal line.",

        "passage": "George Carew, the English Lord President of Munster, managed more or less to quash the rebellion in Munster by mid-1601, using a mixture of conciliation and force. By the summer of 1601 he had retaken most of the principal castles in Munster and scattered the Irish forces. He did this by negotiating a pact with Florence MacCarthy, the principal Gaelic Irish leader in the province, which allowed MacCarthy to be neutral, while Carew concentrated on attacking the force of James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald, who commanded the main rebel force. As a result, while MacCarthy resisted English raiding parties into his territory, he did not come to Fitzthomas's aid, despite urgings from O'Neill and O'Donnell to do this. In the summer of 1600, Carew launched an offensive against Fitzthomas's forces. The English routed Fitzthomas' forces at Aherlow and in November, Carew reported to London that he had, over the summer, killed 1,200 'rebels' and taken the surrenders of over 10,000. Carew also weakened Florence MacCarthy's position by recruiting a rival MacCarthy chieftain, Donal, to English service. In June 1601, James Fitzthomas was captured by the English forces. Shortly afterwards, Carew had Florence MacCarthy arrested after summoning him for negotiations. Both Fitzthomas and MacCarthy were held captive in the Tower of London, where both eventually died. Most of the rest of the local lords submitted, once the principal native leaders had been arrested. O'Neill's mercenaries had been expelled from the province.",

        "passage": "The first war began as a result of disputes between a prominent African merchant, John Cabess  who had armed forces loyal to him, in Eguafo and the Dutch West India Company . Cabess was a formal and loyal ally to the British Royal African Company and assisted their operations in the region. The Dutch, in competition with the Royal African Company, had a series of disputes with Cabess including an instance in 1684 with the Dutch panyarring Cabess and taking his goods. The disputes intensified in November 1694 when Cabess invited the British Royal African Company to return to Komenda and then attacked Dutch miners outside of the city. With the British reoccupying the former British fort in Komenda they were fired upon by the Dutch fort. As a result of these hostilities, the British, Dutch, and Eguafo king began contacting possible allies in surrounding African kingdoms to prepare for a war. Cabess Terra and Twifo initially joined the Dutch, but this alliance was stopped when Denkyira threatened to attack Twifo if war should break out. The Adoms took money from Eguafo to remain neutral in any fighting. War broke out in February 1695 when the forces of John Cabess attacked the Dutch fort and prevented reinforcements. On April 28, 1695, the Twifo forces were defeated. The war then largely took the form of panyarring where one force would seize members of other groups regularly. John Cabess and the Dutch began negotiations that year, but on June 26, the Dutch head at the fort, Willem Bosman, drew a pistol and attempted to shoot at Cabess. Panyarring and occasional violence broke out until a short-lived peace settlement was reached in the end of 1695.",

The Treaty on 5 March 1626, restored the pre-1618 situation with important qualifications. Jurisdiction was nominally restored over the Valtellina; this was now recognized as Catholic, which strengthened its autonomy and introduced doubt as to who could decide on transit through the valley. Papal troops replaced the French though the forts were supposed to be destroyed. Monz\u00f3n represented a serious reverse for Richelieu who blamed his envoy for the terms and feigned illness to avoid seeing the furious Savoyard ambassador. Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In the spring of 1625 they regained Bahia in Brazil and Breda in the Netherlands from the Dutch. In the autumn they repulsed the English at Cadiz.",

Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed. The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated by the start of the conflict. The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000-11,000 soldiers took part in the war. The 1st Infantry Brigade, the only one trained to NATO standards, was serving in Iraq at the beginning of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant that Georgia did not intend to attack.:57",

Anderson ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 7-6.  In the second quarter, the Bengals moved back into the lead when Dalton found Alex Erickson on a 29-yard pass to make it 13-7 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Broncos came within 3 when Brandon McManus kicked a 45-yard field goal to make it 13-10.  Though in the fourth quarter, the Bengals moved up by double digits when Dalton found A.J. Green on an 18-yard pass to make it 20-10.  The Broncos then concluded the scoring of the game when Brock Osweiler found Demaryius Thomas on a 17-yard pass to make the final score 20-17. With the win, the Bengals improved to 4-6.

        "passage": "In May 1704, a Bourbon army won a series of minor victories along the Spain/Portugal border, offset by the Allied capture of Gibraltar, a vital strategic possession. Attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval Battle of M\u00e1laga in August, with a land siege having been abandoned in July. In June 1705, the 'Pact of Genoa' between Catalan representatives and England opened a second front in the north-east; the loss of Barcelona and Valencia meant Toulon was the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean. Philip's army tried to retake Barcelona in May 1706 but were repulsed, his absence allowing an Allied force from Portugal to enter Madrid and Zaragossa. The Allies could not be resupplied so far from their bases and had to withdraw; by November 1706, the Bourbons controlled Castile, Murcia and parts of Valencia. An Allied attempt to regain the initiative in 1707 ended with defeat at Almansa in April while an attack on Toulon in August also failed; by December 1707, Archduke Charles retained only Catalonia. The British capture of Menorca in 1708 combined with Gibraltar gave them control of the Western Mediterranean. By the end of 1708, British objectives had largely been achieved, Portugal and the Dutch Republic were financially exhausted while Austria refused to commit significant resources. As a result, Allied objectives in Spain were unclear.",

It largely involved peasants, most of them Catholics. It was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule. In the wake of the Matsukura clan's construction of a new castle at Shimabara, taxes were drastically raised, which provoked anger from local peasants and r\u014dnin . Religious persecution of the local Catholics exacerbated the discontent, which turned into open revolt in 1637. The Tokugawa Shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops to suppress the rebels and, after a lengthy siege against the rebels at Hara Castle, defeated them. In the wake of the rebellion, the Catholic rebel leader Amakusa Shir\u014d was beheaded and the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced. Japan's national seclusion policy was tightened and official persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s. Following the successful suppression of the rebellion, the daimy\u014d of Shimabara, Matsukura Katsuie, was beheaded for misruling, becoming the only daimy\u014d to be beheaded during the Edo period.",

        "passage": "The Shimabara Rebellion  was an uprising in what is now Nagasaki Prefecture in southwestern Japan lasting from December 17, 1637, to April 15, 1638, during the Edo period. It largely involved peasants, most of them Catholics. It was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule. In the wake of the Matsukura clan's construction of a new castle at Shimabara, taxes were drastically raised, which provoked anger from local peasants and r\u014dnin . Religious persecution of the local Catholics exacerbated the discontent, which turned into open revolt in 1637. The Tokugawa Shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops to suppress the rebels and, after a lengthy siege against the rebels at Hara Castle, defeated them. In the wake of the rebellion, the Catholic rebel leader Amakusa Shir\u014d was beheaded and the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced. Japan's national seclusion policy was tightened and official persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s. Following the successful suppression of the rebellion, the daimy\u014d of Shimabara, Matsukura Katsuie, was beheaded for misruling, becoming the only other daimy\u014d to be beheaded during the Edo period apart from Shimazu Nariakira.",

The Steelers would tie it up later on as Chris Boswell nailed a field goal from 24 yards out to make the game 3-3.  In the second quarter, it was all Chiefs when Santos nailed 2 more field goals:  from 27 and 22 yards out moving ahead 6-3 and the eventual halftime score of 9-3.  After the break, the Chiefs moved ahead by double digits when Chircandrick West ran for a 1-yard touchdown for a 16-3 game.  Backup QB Landry Jones was able to find Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard pass to make the score 16-10 for the Steelers later on in the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers came within 3 when Boswell nailed another field goal from 36-yards out for a 16-13 game.  However, the Chiefs eventually sealed the win when Alex Smith found Chris Conley on a 6-yard pass for a final score of 23-13. With the loss, the Steelers fell to 4-3 and also 2-2 without Roethlisberger as the starter. The defense failed to force any takeaways, but got inside the pocket and sacked Smith twice.",

In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as Dolphins QB Chad Pennington completed a 53-yard TD pass to RB Patrick Cobbs.  The Texans would respond with kicker Kris Brown getting a 27-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Miami added onto its lead as Pennington completed an 80-yard TD pass to Cobbs.  Houston would answer with Brown kicking a 33-yard field goal and WR Jacoby Jones returning a punt 70 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the Texans took the lead with QB Matt Schaub completing a 12-yar TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Dolphins replied with RB Ricky Williams getting a 5-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Houston regained the lead as Brown got a 42-yard field goal, yet Miami struck back RB Ronnie Brown got a 6-yard TD run.  Fortunately, the Texans got the last laugh as Schaub got the game-winning 3-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion). With the thrilling win, Houston won its first game of the season and improved to 1-4.",

That year, his Untitled (1981), a painting of a haloed, black-headed man with a bright red skeletal body, depicted amid the artists signature scrawls, was sold by Robert Lehrman for $16.3 million, well above its $12 million high estimate. A similar untitled piece, also undertaken in 1981 and formerly owned by the Israel Museum, sold for \u00a312.92 million at Christies London, setting a world auction record for Basquiats work. In 2013, Basquiats piece Dustheads sold for $48.8 million at Christies. In 2016 an untitled piece sold at Christies for $57.3 million to a Japanese businessman and collector, Yusaku Maezawa.",

        "passage": "Results of Albanias efforts were initially encouraging. Led by the agricultural sector, real Gross domestic product grew by an estimated 111% in 1993, 89% in 1994, and more than 119% in 1995, with most of this growth in the private sector. Annual inflation dropped from 25% in 1991 to zero. The Albanian currency, the Lek (currency), stabilized. Albania became less dependent on food aid. The speed and vigour of private entrepreneurial response to Albanias opening and liberalizing was better than expected. Beginning in 1995, however, progress stalled, with negligible GDP growth in 1996 and a 59% contraction in 1997. A weakening of government resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 0.12%. Inflation approached 0.20% in 1996 and 0.50% in 1997. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997 - which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albanias population - triggered severe social unrest which led to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an 0.08% drop in GDP. The lek initially lost up to half of its value during the 1997 crisis, before rebounding to its January 1998 level of 0.00143 to the dollar. The new government, installed in July 1997, has taken strong measures to restore public order and to revive economic activity and trade.",

        "passage": " The Giants opened their new home in search of revenge against the Panthers, who had soundly defeated them in the last game at Giants Stadium. In the first quarter, Carolina scored the stadium's first points as kicker John Kasay got a 21-yard field goal. New York would answer with the stadium's first touchdown as quarterback Eli Manning found wide receiver Hakeem Nicks from 26 yards out. The Panthers would retake the lead in the second quarter as Kasay made field goals from 52 and 43 yards. Manning found Nicks again on a 19-yard touchdown pass with less than a minute left in the first half, but Carolina quarterback Matt Moore completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith with six seconds remaining. The Giants would get back on top in the third quarter as kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 32-yard field goal, followed by Nicks' third touchdown of the game (a 6-yard catch). In the fourth quarter, the Giants added one more touchdown as running back Ahmad Bradshaw ran for a 4-yard score. Carolina's Greg Hardy blocked a Matt Dodge punt out of the end zone to round out the scoring with a safety. The Giants' historic win had come with a price, however; tight end Kevin Boss left the game in the first quarter with a concussion, and Will Beatty, who filled in for Boss afterward, was benched with a broken foot. The Giants signed tight end Bear Pascoe from their practice squad to play against the Colts.",

While everyone expected him to head for Royal Prussia, he disembarked on Zealand on 17 August, and headed for Copenhagen, which was defended by 10,650 Danes and 2,000 Dutch. This time however, the town did not surrender, and a long siege ensued. When Swedish forces took Kronborg in September, they controlled both sides of the \u00d8resund, yet in November a Dutch fleet broke the Swedish naval blockade of Copenhagen in the Battle of the Sound. Meanwhile, the anti-Swedish alliance had deployed an army to Denmark, to confront Charles X Gustav with a force of 14,500 Brandenburgers commanded by Frederick William, 10,600 Austrians commanded by Raimondo Montecuccoli, and 4,500 Poles commanded by Czarniecki. By January 1659, the allied forces stood at Fredriksodde, Kolding and Als. Charles X Gustav then tried a decisive assault on Copenhagen on 21 and 22 February, but was repelled.",

        "passage": " Coming off their rout over the Bills, the Cardinals stayed at home for a crucial Week 6 showdown with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, the Cardinals immediately took flight as RB J. J. Arrington returned the game's opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Cowboys tied the game as QB Tony Romo completed a 55-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. In the third quarter, Dallas took the lead with Romo completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR Miles Austin. Arizona would tie the game with QB Kurt Warner completing a two-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald. In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals regained the lead as Warner completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Steve Breaston, along with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 41-yard field goal. However, the Cowboys tied the game as Romo completed a 70-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber, along with kicker Nick Folk nailing a 52-yard field goal. In overtime, after forcing a three-and-out, Arizona got the win as WR Sean Morey blocked a Mat McBriar punt attempt, allowing LB Monty Beisel to return it 3 yards for the game-winning touchdown. McBriar would end up with his foot fractured and put on the IR by the Cowboys. With the impressive win, the Cardinals entered their bye week at 4-2. In the NFL's 423rd recorded overtime game, this was the first game to end with a blocked punt getting returned for a touchdown.",

        "passage": " Coming off their win over the Colts, the Cowboys went home for a Week 14 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.  Dallas trailed early in the first quarter as Eagles quarterback Michael Vick got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Cowboys answered with quarterback Jon Kitna finding tight end Jason Witten on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles regained the lead in the second quarter with Vick completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to offensive guard Todd Herremans.  Afterwards, Dallas closed out the half with a 50-yard field goal from kicker David Buehler. The Cowboys took the lead in the third quarter with Buehler's 43-yard field goal, followed by a 3-yard touchdown run from running back Felix Jones.  Philadelphia struck back with kicker David Akers getting a 39-yard field goal.  The Eagles took the lead again in the fourth quarter with Akers booting a 50-yard field goal, followed by Vick completing a 91-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and Akers making a 28-yard field goal.  Dallas tried to rally as Kitna hooked up with Witten again on a 22-yard touchdown pass, yet the Eagles held on for the win. With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 4-9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention, assuring them not playing the Super Bowl on their own home turf (something that still has yet to happen in Super Bowl history).  The loss also secured the Cowboys' first losing season since 2004.",

Nationally the Church of England baptises one child in ten (2011). In 2015, the churchs statistics showed that 2.6 million people attended a special Advent service, 2.4 million attended a Christmas service, 1.3 million attended an Easter service, and 980,000 attended service during an average week. In 2016, 2.6 million people attended a Christmas service, 1.2 million attended an Easter service, 1.1 million people attended a service in the Church of England each month, an average of 930,000 people attended a weekly service, an additional 180,000 attended a service for school each week, and an average of 740,000 people attended Sunday service.",

        "passage": " Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Reliant Stadium for a Week 5 showdown with the Houston Texans.  In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Texans RB Ron Dayne getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Dolphins answered with kicker Jay Feely getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, with less than 4 minutes to go in the period, history came back to haunt QB Trent Green.  During an offensive play, WR Ted Ginn, Jr. was running with the ball and Green went low to block DT Travis Johnson.  Trent got hit in the head with Johnson's knee, knocking him unconscious with a concussion.  Johnson would then get flagged for taunting the unconscious Trent Green.  With Green out of the game, back-up Cleo Lemon came in and helped the Dolphins take the lead with RB Ronnie Brown getting a 3-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami increased its lead with Feely getting a 40-yard and a 33-yard field goal.  Houston ended the half with kicker Kris Brown getting a 54-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Dolphins' lead was erased with Brown giving Houston a 43-yard and a 54-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Miami reclaimed the lead with Feely kicking a 48-yard field goal.  However, the Texans would pull out the win with Brown getting not only a 20-yard field goal, but a gut-punching 57-yard field goal. With their fifth-straight loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-5, but they also suffered their first 8-straight losing streak since 1967.",

Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industrys proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York Citys finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.",
