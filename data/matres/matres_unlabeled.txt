Suspected bombs exploded outside the U.S. embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday , killing dozens of people , witnesses said .
The American ambassador to Kenya was among hundreds injured , a local TV said .
`` It was definitely a bomb , '' said a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi , who refused to identify himself .
`` You can see a huge crater behind the building , and a bomb went off at the embassy in Tanzania at the same time , '' he said .
Terrorist bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania blew apart buildings and buses , trapping people under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers cleared with cranes , blow torches and bare hands .
At least 82 were killed and more than 1,700 injured , officials said as dawn broke Saturday .
Dozens of people were still missing , however , and the death toll was expected to rise , they said .
The suspected car bombings occurred 700 kilometers ( 450 miles ) from each other but just minutes apart on Friday , turning busy streets in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel .
`` This appears to have been a very well-coordinated , very well-planned attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs , '' U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington .
No one has claimed responsibility .
( 0735 GMT ) Friday , toppling a crowded building toward the embassy and a street packed with cars , trucks and buses .
At least 75 people were killed and 1,643 wounded there , Red Cross and ambulance officials said .
The bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook furniture in homes a mile away .
But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have prevented the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya , an official said Saturday .
The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam , Tanzania 's laid-back capital of swaying palms and sparse traffic , is largely free from the congestion that plagues most other major African cities .
KENYA : Total Dead : 192 Americans : 12 Injured : 4,877 Hospitalized : 542 Treated and discharged : 4,257
TANZANIA : Total dead : 10 Americans : 0 Injured : 74 Hospitalized : 6
Philippine President Joseph Estrada on Tuesday condemned the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and offered condolences to the victims and their families .
`` We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the victims of these outrages and to their families in Kenya , Tanzania and the United States , '' Estrada said in a statement .
`` No cause is so great that it can justify wanton murder and maiming of the innocent . ''
In all , the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last week claimed at least 217 lives and injured nearly 5,000 .
The Security Council condemned the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Thursday and called on all states to cooperate with authorities in finding those responsible .
A resolution , co-sponsored by Kenya , Tanzania and the United States and unanimously adopted , `` expresses its deep sorrow , sympathy and condolences to the families of the innocent victims of the terrorist bomb attacks at this difficult time . ''
It strongly condemns the `` terrorist bomb attacks . ''
And it stresses that every nation `` has the duty to refrain from organizing , instigating , assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another state . ''
The almost simultaneous attacks Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500 .
`` The incidents of Aug. 7 underscore that terrorists know no boundaries , and that the suppression of international terrorism , the arrest , the conviction and the punishment of its perpetrators are essential to the maintenance of international peace and security , '' said the U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh .
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy staffers on a whirlwind visit to East Africa , and promised to track down the perpetrators .
`` Together , we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our friends , '' she told American and Tanzanian workers at the bomb-hit U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .
Officials in Tanzania and Kenya , where she arrived next , also hoped she would produce new aid for their countries , where the Aug. 7 terrorist blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam .
FBI agents , meanwhile , pushed ahead with their all-out investigation into the bombings .
Contrary to other reports , the FBI and Kenyan police said Monday that a suspect who was returned from Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated anyone else after three days of questioning .
Albright , arriving after a 16-hour flight , spent about five hours in Tanzania before heading to Nairobi in a small plane when an engine of the Boeing 747 she had flown in from Washington overheated .
She was scheduled to lay flowers at the bombed embassy , talk to Kenyan embassy guards and others who survived the blast and meet with President Daniel arap Moi in a five-hour visit before returning home .
In Dar es Salaam , she laid a wreath next to the crater left by the embassy blast that killed 10 people .
Then she handed a folded American flag to U.S. Marines and , wearing a white construction hard hat , toured the damage inside .
Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered throughout the embassy .
Albright helped hang a poster advertising a reward of up to dlrs 2 million for information leading to the bombers ' arrest .
She then lavished praise , and the State Department 's award for heroism , on embassy staffers before meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili Medical Center and with government officials .
`` America is very proud of you , all of you _ Americans and Tanzanians , '' she told the staffers .
Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds ( 225 kilograms ) of medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
She also pledged to ask Congress to approve a still-undetermined amount of emergency funding to pay for re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and Kenya and to compensate victims ' families .
Officials in the two African countries are counting on substantial compensation along with assurances of aid for the governments , whose key tourism industries were dealt a blow by the bombings .
But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete , speaking at a joint news conference with Albright , said there are no ill feelings in Tanzania toward Americans because of their handling of the rescue , as there are among some Kenyans .
`` The bomb blast has not generated any hatred against ...
Americans in Tanzania , '' he said .
He also urged Albright to tell Americans that Tanzania is safe and they should continue visiting and investing in the country .
Albright told the foreign minister the American people share in the profound sorrow of the Tanzanians and said the United States will maintain its presence throughout Africa and throughout the world .
`` These bombings will not cause America to back down or retreat , '' she declared .
The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam , Kenneth Piernick , said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people there , but indicated that most of the interrogations had led nowhere .
`` Right now my evidence is scant , and I 'm not going to draw conclusions based on that , '' he said .
He would not elaborate , or comment on whether two suspects remained in detention , as was previously reported .
In Nairobi , a top Kenyan police official denied a newspaper report that more arrests had been made there .
Officials said last week that six people were in custody for questioning about the bombing .
About 200 Americans _ nonessential U.S. Embassy staff and their families _ left Pakistan today on orders from Washington following a `` pattern of threats '' against Americans there since the Africa bombings .
The diplomats were flown to Brussels , Belgium .
Other Americans have also been urged to leave .
The United States had the right to defend its citizens against terrorist actions , New Zealand said Friday in response to U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan .
Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that terrorist bombings this month of U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , `` show that terrorism is an indiscriminate killer of innocent people . ''
Retaliating 13 days after the deadly embassy bombings in East Africa , U.S. forces Thursday launched cruise missile strikes against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan .
`` Countries have the right to defend themselves and their citizens against terrorism and New Zealand appreciates and understands the steps the United States has taken , '' McKinnon said .
The embassy bombings , on Aug. 7 , killed 247 people in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania .
More than 5,500 people were injured , mostly Kenyans .
McKinnon 's spokeswoman said the United States had `` very good intelligence '' linking the sites struck overnight with the embassy attacks .
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped up some unfinished business on Wednesday , meeting with Kenya 's trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car bombing of the embassy .
On Aug. 7 , Bushnell , Trade Minister Joseph Kimotho and others had just ended a news conference in a building adjacent to the embassy .
They were talking when the bomb went off , killing 247 people and wounding more than 5,000 others .
On Wednesday , Bushnell and Kimotho met again to finish their discussion , Bushnell told Kenya Television .
The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast , which damaged the embassy , shattered the glass shell of the 22-story Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi House .
Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent search and rescue at the blast scene , memorials for those slain , and the relocation to a temporary embassy .
Kimotho , who was hospitalized with a head wound , said he and Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley in September .
His trip is still on , the embassy said .
The blast in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment as an explosion ripped through the American Embassy in Tanzania 's commercial capital Dar es Salaam .
The death toll in the Tanzania blast , initially 10 , has risen to 12 , hospital officials and family members said Wednesday .
Tanzania expelled five Iraqis and a Libyan who were questioned by the FBI and police in connection of the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last month , a newspaper reported Friday .
Immigration officials escorted the Libyan , Atif Issa Enhamed , to the airport and put him on a flight to an undisclosed Middle East destination , said Uhuru , or Freedom , a Swahili newspaper owned by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party .
Five Iraqis , whose names were not disclosed , also were deported , the newspaper said .
It gave no reason for the expulsions and Tanzania 's criminal investigation and immigration departments could not be reached for comment .
Nearly simultaneous bombings at U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya , on Aug. 7 killed 258 people , including 12 Americans , and injured more than 5,500 people .
Of those killed , 11 were killed in Tanzania .
Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing have been handed over to the United States for trial .
American authorities allege the attacks were plotted by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden .
On Sunday , Tanzanian police and FBI agents said they had made `` extraordinary discoveries , '' having determined what the Dar es Salaam bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy .
They refused to provide details .
Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the bombs had originated in the Middle East and were transferred by sea via the Comoro Islands to Tanzania .
Reports in Kenya said the components of the bomb that exploded in Nairobi were transported by road from Tanzania to Kenya .
The East African nations share a long and mostly unguarded border .
On Sept. 2 , police in the Comoros archipelago , off the Tanzanian coast , raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul , a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the bombings .
U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on Wednesday led a team of medical specialists to Africa to help victims of terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
`` We want to build on the long-term partnership that has existed between our countries to help innocent Kenyans who suffered in the bombing , '' Satcher said at a news conference .
`` At the same time , we want to help Kenya prepare to meet future medical disasters , regardless of their cause . ''
The bombings on Aug. 7 killed 259 people , including 12 Americans , and injured more than 5,500 .
The U.S. team includes plastic surgeons with experience in physical reconstruction , and a psychiatrist who worked in Oklahoma City , where 168 people were killed in a bombing in 1995 .
The team planned to leave Nairobi on Thursday for Dar es Salaam .
Besides meeting the immediate physical and emotional needs of bombing victims , the United States will consider helping set up a disaster response center in Kenya , Satcher said .
In addition to providing assistance using resources of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , Satcher said he will report to Congress on additional needs .
U.S. President Bill Clinton has requested dlrs 50 million in emergency assistance funding from Congress for Tanzania and Kenya .
The U.S. government already has contributed dlrs 3.2 million in assistance to the two countries .
On Friday , the Kenyan government planned to pay the first 32 death claims of 100,000 Kenyan shillings ( dlrs 1,667 ) each .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic can now participate in NATO strategy planning , because all NATO member states have approved their joining the alliance , German defense minister Rudolf Scharping said Saturday .
The Netherlands early this week became the last country to ratify NATO expansion to include the three former Warsaw Pact nations .
The three are expected to join in April , as part of marking NATO 's 50th anniversary .
With their membership secure , they also can participate in planning for the NATO summit in April .
Scharping , ending a two-day visit , said Poland was well prepared to join the alliance .
Germany has been a strong advocate of Poland 's access to NATO , saying it will serve European security and stability .
Preliminary DNA tests link a missing anti-abortion activist to a strand of hair found near where a sniper shot and killed a Buffalo , N.Y. , doctor who performed abortions , a law enforcement official said Friday .
The first round of DNA tests on the hair at the FBI Laboratory here established a high probability it came from the same person as a hair found in a New Jersey home where James C. Kopp , a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester , lived last year , the official said .
The first DNA tests did not exclude a match between the two strands .
Kopp has eluded authorities since they obtained a warrant for him as a material witness in the Oct. 23 sniper shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian , a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who performed abortions .
The search for Kopp was recently extended to Mexico .
Meantime , FBI agents and Metropolitan Police officers assigned to a joint terrorism task force here scanned the crowd of anti-abortion protesters at the annual March for Life on Capitol Hill , because Kopp has been either a participant in or arrested at this march in each of the last three years , according to another law enforcement official ,
Both officials requested anonymity .
The FBI is conducting further DNA tests of the hair found outside Dr. Slepian 's home .
This more extensive set of tests could enable officials to declare an absolute match between the two hair strands , the first law enforcement official said .
`` Ultimately , we would need to have a hair taken directly from Kopp himself to establish conclusively the hair from scene is his , '' the official added .
The official said the hair was in a cap that authorities found very near the location from which the sniper is thought to have fired the rifle bullet that killed Slepian as he stood in the kitchen of his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst , N.Y .
But The Buffalo News reported Friday that the hair was in a packet , with at least two bullets , that was found buried in the ground more than 50 feet from a tree where police believe the sniper stood and fired .
Last week , FBI Director Louis Freeh , on an official visit to Mexico , asked Mexican authorities to join the hunt for Kopp , federal officials have said .
They believe Kopp was driven to Mexico by a female friend after the shooting , and have a trail of her credit card receipts leading to Mexico , the federal officials have said .
In addition , a Customs Service videotape from a border crossing point shows the woman 's car returning from Mexico , these officials said .
Authorities obtained a material-witness arrest warrant for Kopp after they said Kopp 's car was spotted in Amherst in the weeks before Slepian was killed .
Kopp 's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered last month at Newark , N.J. , International Airport , the FBI said .
The car had been in the long-term lot for about two weeks , said Greg Trevor , a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The creator of an anti-abortion Web site found to be a threat to abortion providers says a decision to shut the site down is just a `` temporary setback . ''
Neal Horsley said Friday that he would seek a new Internet service for his `` Nuremburg Files '' site , which was the focus of a federal court trial that led to a $107 million verdict this week in favor of abortion providers .
Horsley was not a defendant in the suit , in which the Portland , Ore. , jury ruled that such sites constitute threats to abortion providers .
MindSpring , which provided the Internet space for the site , closed it Thursday night for violating `` our appropriate use policies , '' spokesman Serge Clermont said .
The Web site included the names and addresses of abortion doctors and featured photos of mangled fetuses and drawings of dripping blood .
Three times , doctors whose names appeared on the list were killed , most recently last October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was gunned down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo , N.Y. His name on the Web site was crossed out that same day .
Pathway Communications , which has maintained the site , said in a statement that `` The Nuremberg Files '' was knocked off-line without notice .
The company said it was informed Friday that it violated MindSpring 's policy on `` threatening and harassing language . ''
Horsley called the move a `` temporary setback . ''
`` We are presently searching for a bolder and more principled ( Internet service provider ) to host the Nuremburg Files , '' the statement said .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has invited the foreign ministers of Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary to a ceremony in Independence , Mo. , on March 12 to mark the accession of the three countries into the NATO alliance .
The ceremony will take place at the Truman Presidential Library .
The venue was chosen to honor the announcement by President Truman of the creation of NATO 50 years ago , the State Department said .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic today became full-fledged members of NATO , less than a decade after exchanging communist rule for democracy and shedding their Cold War military ties to the Soviet Union .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted admission papers from the three countries ' foreign ministers , marking their formal entry into the 50-year-old alliance .
`` Hallelujah , '' Albright exclaimed .
`` Hungary has come home .
We are back in the family , '' said Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi .
In a touch of symbolism , the ceremony took place at the Harry S. Truman Library .
It was during the Truman presidency that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded to halt the westward spread of Soviet-led communism .
Ironically , NATO 's three newest members just a decade ago were still under the Soviet umbrella .
Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said he was in nearby Kansas City working with the anti-Soviet undergound in 1968 when Russian troops swept through Praque in the occupation of Czechoslovakia .
`` It is for me very symbolic that it is precisely here that we today accept the guarantee that my country never again will become the powerless victim of foreign invasion , '' Kavan said .
In looking ahead to even greater expansion of NATO , Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said , `` We should keep the door of the alliance open for those who have fought for freedom ...
Another curtain should never descend on Europe . ''
Since 1949 , it has been expanded to include Greece and Turkey in 1952 , Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982 .
The new additions bring the total to 19 and many other hopefuls are waiting in the wings : Slovenia , Romania , Bulgaria , Slovakia , Lithuania , Estonia and Latvia .
Just what NATO will do with these eager applicants is not clear .
The issue is expected to dominate a NATO summit set for Washington in April .
NATO 's mission has changed dramatically since its founding in 1949 , a time when the West was intent on halting the westward spread of Soviet-led communism -- a threat Winston Churchill warned about in his famous `` Iron Curtain '' speech delivered on March 5 , 1946 , at Westminster College in Fulton , Mo. , 130 miles east of here .
NATO warplanes helped end the war in Bosnia almost four years ago and now are poised to intervene in Yugoslavia should peace efforts in the province of Kosovo fail .
A decade ago , the military planning of Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic was built around the possibility of a ground assault toward the west .
As NATO allies , the goal is much smaller armies capable of meeting a variety of contingencies .
The State Department says the three new members `` enhance NATO 's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense , respond to a range of security challenges and reduce the possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has claimed so many American lives . ''
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says , `` The accession of the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland ... is perhaps the clearest demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing closer together . ''
`` Extending membership to these three democracies helps to stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground for many of the disasters of this century . ''
But many Russians -- and some Americans -- are wary about the eastward encroachment of NATO .
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev says the push east signifies a rejection of the common European security system that was discussed at the end of the Cold War .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov calls extending NATO membership into Eastern Europe `` a movement in the wrong direction . ''
`` All European states must cooperate in creating a joint security system , '' he was quoted as saying .
`` All European states must work together in the interests of all countries rather than of separate groups . ''
A rifle found near the home of a slain abortion doctor may yield important clues for investigators trying to track down the gunman .
Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed in his kitchen by a sniper 's bullet last fall .
Investigators said Friday they found a rifle buried near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst .
The gun was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington to determine whether it was used to kill Slepian .
`` If it 's not too badly rusted , they may be able to match the bullet back to the weapon , '' said Walter Rowe , forensics sciences professor at George Washington University .
The rifle might also have clothing fibers , fingerprints or a serial number that can be traced to the buyer , Rowe said .
Buried a foot beneath the ground , the weapon was unearthed during a search of a heavily wooded , four-acre area Thursday .
Investigators did not say how close the weapon was to the house .
Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought as a material witness in the shooting .
Investigators said Kopp 's car was seen in the neighborhood in the days before the slaying .
Kopp vanished after the shooting , and the car was found abandoned at the Newark , N.J. , airport in December .
Officials said DNA test results showed a likelihood that a strand of hair discovered behind Slepian 's home came from Kopp .
An abortion foe who is the subject of an international manhunt was charged with murder Thursday in the slaying of a doctor who was cut down in his kitchen by a sniper 's bullet .
Federal and state arrest warrants were issued for James C. Kopp , 44 , of St. Albans , Vt .
His whereabouts are unknown .
`` We have probable cause to believe this man , James Kopp , is responsible for the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian , '' FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said .
Investigators have been searching for Kopp since shortly after the Oct. 23 slaying .
Up until Thursday , however , they had described him only as a material witness wanted for questioning -- not a suspect .
In addition to a state charge of murder , Kopp faces a federal charge of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor .
Both charges carry up to life in prison .
The federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000 .
The newly filed charges will intensify the ongoing international manhunt , Tolbert said .
In response to the new charges , Canadian officials confirmed that Kopp is a suspect in sniper shootings that injured abortion doctors in November in Vancouver , British Columbia ; Winnipeg , Manitoba ; and Hamilton , Ontario .
Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but said last month 's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough .
Slepian , 52 , was shot with a rifle .
Authorities have said they believe the weapon may have been buried in advance of the shooting , with the killer digging it up to fire the shot , then reburying it and fleeing .
Kopp also has been linked , through DNA testing , to a strand of hair found near where the sniper fired , law enforcement sources have said .
Nicknamed the `` Atomic Dog '' in anti-abortion circles , Kopp had been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion .
His car was spotted in Slepian 's suburban Amherst neighborhood in the weeks before the shooting , and was found abandoned at New Jersey 's Newark International Airport in December , investigators said .
Kopp 's stepmother , who married Kopp 's father when Kopp was in his 30s , said Thursday from her home in Irving , Texas : `` I would like to see him come forward and clear his name if he 's not guilty , and if he 's guilty , to contact a priest and make his amends with society , face what he did . ''
Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack .
Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham , Ala. , abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse .
He also is charged in three Atlanta attacks , including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one person .
Dr. Barnett Slepian , just back from synagogue , was heating soup in his kitchen last fall when he was gunned down with a single shot through a window .
Slepian 's killer is still at large .
But for the first time , authorities have named a suspect in the slaying -- anti-abortion activist James Kopp .
`` Today , I 'm here to tell you we have our suspect , '' said Bernard Tolbert , special agent-in-charge of the FBI 's Buffalo office .
Kopp , 44 , of St. Albans , Vt. , became the subject of an international manhunt in November when he was called a witness in the case .
He was charged Thursday in state and federal complaints with second-degree murder and with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor .
Both charges carry a penalty of up to life in prison .
The federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000 .
Kopp 's whereabouts remain unknown .
He was last seen Nov. 3 , the day before authorities issued a material witness warrant in the Slepian shooting in the hope of questioning him .
Until Thursday , they had not called Kopp a suspect .
Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but said last month 's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough .
Slepian , 52 , was shot with a rifle .
Kopp also has been linked , through DNA testing , to a strand of hair found near where the sniper fired , law enforcement sources have said .
Nicknamed the `` Atomic Dog '' in anti-abortion circles , Kopp had been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion .
His car was spotted in Slepian 's neighborhood in the weeks before the shooting , and was found abandoned at the Newark , N.J. , airport in December .
The filing of the charges has intensified interest in Kopp as a suspect in three non-fatal sniper attacks on Canadian abortion providers , and one near Rochester , N.Y. , between 1994 and 1997 .
Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack .
Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham , Ala. , abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse .
He also is charged in three Atlanta attacks , including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one person .
The FBI put alleged terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden and anti-abortion activist and accused doctor killer James Charles Kopp on the bureau 's list of the Ten Most Wanted fugitives Monday .
FBI Director Louis Freeh said the U.S. government is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Bin Laden , indicted as the architect of the twin bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The Aug. 7 , 1998 , bombings killed more than 200 people , including 12 Americans .
It is the largest reward the government has ever offered for a fugitive .
A total of $650,000 , meanwhile , is being offered for information leading to the arrest of Kopp , who is charged with gunning down Dr. Barnett Slepian last fall in his home in Buffalo , N.Y. Slepian provided legal abortions in western New York state .
The standard $50,000 reward for information leading to a listed fugitive 's capture comes on top of a $500,000 reward announced earlier by Attorney General Janet Reno , plus a $100,000 award offered previously by the FBI .
Reno said Bin Laden and Kopp have one thing in common : Each wrongly believes he is justified in using all means possible to achieve his goal .
They also have in common locations unknown to the authorities .
Freeh said Bin Laden may be hiding out in Afghanistan , which has been uncooperative in the case .
Kopp , meanwhile , may have approached the border with Mexico , but it is unknown whether he crossed into that country , said Freeh .
Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic , and the majority of jobs he has held over the past 20 years have been related to the anti-abortion movement , the Justice Department said in a news release .
State Department international security director Dave Carpenter said that placing Bin Laden on the most-wanted list `` underscores the unwavering commitment '' by the United States `` to fight terrorism . ''
The FBI continues to receive threats from individuals and organizations with ties to Bin Laden , Freeh said .
Carpenter said the U.S. government 's counterterrorism program has paid out over $6 million in some 20 cases around the world for credible information .
On the FBI list , Bin Laden and Kopp replace two former Libyan intelligence agents charged in the Dec. 21 , 1988 , bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie , Scotland .
The two were removed from the list after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed in April to hand them over for trial in the Netherlands , a neutral venue .
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are charged with murder , conspiracy to commit murder and violations of international aviation safety laws .
Bin Laden and Kopp are the 455th and 456th persons to be placed on the FBI 's most wanted list , which began in 1950 .
Since then , 427 fugitives have been taken into custody or located , 133 of them as a result of citizen assistance , the FBI said .
Six suspects in the Bin Laden investigation are known to be in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York .
Another eight suspects , including Bin Laden , have been charged but not apprehended .
Another suspect is awaiting extradition from Britain .
The FBI says Bin Laden is the leader of a terrorist organization known as Al-Aqeda , `` The Base . ''
Kopp wears eyeglasses , walks with a slight limp , is 5 feet , 10 inches tall and weighs 150 to 175 pounds .
Slepian was killed by a single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a window of his home .
Prior to the Slepian 's shooting , Kopp had traveled the country and world , authorities said .
He has been arrested more than a dozen times during abortion protests in seven states and Italy , but has no felony convictions .
He has used 29 aliases , Freeh said .
A man whose house was allegedly a bomb factory was arrested in connection with last year 's deadly U.S. Embassy blasts in Kenya and Tanzania and was brought to the United States for trial .
The suspect -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed -- was scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan at midday , according to a statement today by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White .
The latest arrest brought to nine the number of people in custody in connection with the bombings .
White heads a team that is investigating and prosecuting the bombings which killed 224 people , including 12 Americans , on Aug. 7 , 1998 .
Mohamed , 24 , allegedly rented a house in his native Tanzania which was used as a bomb factory .
In Cape Town , South Africa , police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said the FBI arrested Mohamed at the city 's airport in the early hours of Thursday morning as he was about to be deported for being in the country illegally .
The Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town reported that a search has been launched for accomplices in the region .
Seventeen people have been indicted in the case .
Bin Laden is accused of masterminding the attack , and is on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List .
A $5 million reward has been offered for his capture .
The bombs went off almost simultaneously .
Eleven people , none of them Americans , died in the blast in Dar-es-Salaam , Tanzania .
Another man has been arrested in connection with the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year that killed 224 people , police said today .
`` I can confirm that an individual was arrested in connection with the embassy bombings and the FBI was involved '' in making the arrest , police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said .
Beer said he did not know where the man was being held or any more details .
The arrest brought to nine the number of people in custody in connection with the bombings .
U.S. authorities scheduled a news conference for later today in New York .
The Cape Argus newspaper reported today that a Tanzanian man was arrested , and that authorities were searching for accomplices .
The Argus quoted immigration official Jurie de Wet as saying the arrests stemmed from information about requests for asylum and temporary residence in Cape Town .
Seventeen people have been indicted in the case .
It was not immediately known if the arrest announced today stemmed from the indictment .
Bin Laden , who is accused of masterminding the attack , is on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List .
A $5 million reward has been offered for his capture .
The bombs went off almost simultaneously on Aug. 7 , 1998 at U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .
About 500 people attended a Sunday night memorial service for the Buffalo-area physician who performed abortions , one year after he was killed by a sniper 's bullet .
A nurse who was critically injured in the 1998 abortion clinic bombing in Birmingham , Ala. , was among those who attended the interfaith ceremony at a Presbyterian church for Dr. Barnett Slepian .
Police kept watch outside and about 25 undercover police were scattered throughout the crowd .
`` Security is tight , '' said Marilynn Buckham , of Buffalo Gyn Womanservices , a sponsor of the ceremony .
`` But it 's not tonight we 're worried about .
A memorial service planned at the University of Rochester for Saturday was canceled after security plans were leaked .
Slepian was killed on Oct. 23 , 1999 by a sniper hiding in his backyard .
Earlier that day , the Slepian family sent a fax to local police explaining that abortion providers were warned that one of them might be targeted for assassination .
On May 6 , James Kopp , 44 , was charged with the slaying .
Kopp remains at-large and police admit that despite a worldwide search and a $1 million reward , they do n't know where he is .
`` It 's very frustrating knowing that he 's out there , '' said Ms. Buckham .
Sunday 's yahrtzeit service ---- a Jewish ceremony that commemorates the dead with the lighting of a 24-hour candle ---- included the lighting of candles for the seven people killed and 12 people injured in abortion-related violence since 1993 .
A tearful audience also listened to registered nurse Emily Lyons , who has undergone a number of operations since the Alabama clinic bombing and has permanently damaged eyesight .
She spoke of Slepian and other abortion providers who have been killed .
`` They paid an awful price for reproductive freedom and the women they served , '' she said .
`` They risked their lives for that freedom . ''
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright headed Tuesday to East Africa , seeking to demonstrate American support after the bombings that targeted U.S. embassies , but mostly claimed African lives .
`` To America 's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam , I will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow , admiration for their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of our country , '' Albright said Monday before leaving Andrews Air Force Base , Maryland .
`` To the people of Kenya and Tanzania , I will bring a message of friendship , made deeper by our shared grief , and of support in doing all we can to ease their suffering and help them start anew . ''
Albright , after a 16-hour flight , is scheduled to spend only five hours on the ground in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , her first stop Tuesday morning , and then about 5 1/2 hours in Nairobi , Kenya , later in the day before returning immediately home .
Albright 's visit to East Africa was designed in part to demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats to Americans .
Some Kenyans have complained that after the Nairobi bombing , rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and to protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives .
But Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that notion , saying the priority had been rescuing all possible , African and American .
On Friday , when Albright set aside vacation plans for the hastily planned trip to East Africa , the State Department lifted a warning against travel to Kenya , whose economy relies heavily on foreign visitors , to further ease any strain in the aftermath of the tragedy .
Just ahead of Albright 's one-day trip , the State Department on Sunday issued an updated `` worldwide caution '' to U.S. travelers in the aftermath of the Aug. 7 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and because of fresh threats to U.S. interests abroad .
An accompanying statement specifically warned `` against all travel to Pakistan . ''
The State Department also ordered the departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi , Lahore and Peshawar .
The warnings came after Pakistan handed over to Kenyan officials a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings , Mohammed Saddiq Odeh , also known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh .
The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing arrived over the weekend at the FBI lab at the bureau 's Washington headquarters and is being analyzed , FBI officials said Monday .
Many more shipments are expected , but the first batch contained cotton swabs taken at the blast site in hopes of picking up microscopic residues that could positively identify what the bomb was made of .
A U.S. official said last week that field tests suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called Semtex that has been used by terrorist groups before .
While an important step , the U.S. government decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba does not guarantee that the boy will be repatriated , the communist leadership warned .
`` Nothing is certain concerning his return to Cuba , '' said a government communique , read Wednesday night at a pro-Elian rally attended by President Fidel Castro .
Cuban exiles in Miami will now `` proceed with all their resources to impede or delay '' the decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service .
The government exhorted citizens to keep up mass protests pressing for Elian 's return until the boy comes home .
`` We cannot stop mobilizing !
The struggle must not stop for one minute ! '' said the message , read during the rally of several thousand Cuban scientists by Hassan Perez , president of the government 's University Students Federation .
Cuba appealed to world opinion , and American opinion in particular , to help prevent its enemies in Miami from trying to block the child 's return .
His mother died trying to get Elian and herself to the United States .
The boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , lives in Cuba and wants him back .
But Elian 's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy permanently , saying they could provide him with a better life than he would have on the communist island .
They said they would appeal the decision , announced Wednesday by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner , that Elian must be returned to his father by Jan. 14 .
Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement .
Neither he nor Elian 's four grandparents could be located Wednesday in their hometown of Cardenas , east of Havana .
While state-run television broadcast footage of Cuban exiles protesting in Miami against the repatriation of Elian Gonzalez , the Cuban government urged its people to keep up their own demonstrations to ensure the boy 's return .
The unusual airing of protests against President Fidel Castro appeared aimed at warning Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still force the reversal of the U.S. government 's decision to return Gonzalez to Cuba .
Castro attended a rally Thursday by media workers at Havana 's Palace of Conventions to demand Gonzalez 's return .
For weeks the communist government has held such rallies almost daily .
`` The case of Elian is for today 's youth what 40 years of the blockade , armed invasions , sabotage and attempts to kill President Fidel Castro were for earlier generations , '' said Cuban journalist Luis Baez , who has written several books about Cuban emigration to the United States .
After the rally , state television showed the Cuban exiles in the streets of Miami -- some of them carrying signs demanding `` Freedom for Elian , '' the same battle cry regularly chanted during rallies on this side of the Florida Straits .
A voiceover to the footage called the exiles `` criminals '' and `` mafia members . ''
Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting `` Liberty !
Liberty ! '' blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami .
In one case , riot police had to use tear gas to clear them .
Saying `` nothing is certain '' about Elian 's return , Cuba 's government exhorted citizens to keep rallying , after the boy 's relatives in Miami said they would look for ways to get around Wednesday 's ruling by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to repatriate the child by Jan. 14 .
Cuban exiles in Miami will now `` proceed with all their resources to impede or delay '' the ruling , Cuba predicted Wednesday .
`` We cannot stop mobilizing !
The struggle must not stop for one minute ! '' said a message that was read Wednesday night to several thousand rallying Cuban scientists .
Rescued on Nov. 25 by fishermen off the Florida coast , Elian has become the subject of an international custody battle .
His mother died in a boating accident trying to get Elian and herself to the United States .
The boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , lives in Cuba and wants Elian back .
But Elian 's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy , saying they could provide him with a better life .
Since the INS decision was announced Wednesday , they have said they will appeal the decision .
Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement .
Neither he nor Elian 's four grandparents could be located in their hometown of Cardenas , east of Havana .
In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez 's return to Cuba , an anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian .
Rep. Dan Burton , R-Ind. , said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10 , so he remains in the country while the courts consider his case .
About 100 supporters cheered wildly as Elian -- holding the subpoena in front of his face while being held aloft by a relative -- appeared outside the house where he has been staying with relatives .
He gave the peace sign before heading back indoors .
Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during a news conference in his hometown of Cardenas .
`` I am the father of Elian and immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him
`` Why should it be delayed ?
Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his mother , stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida by boat .
The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami , but the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14 .
The decision touched off protests in the Cuban-American community .
Burton , the committee 's chairman , said in a release he `` issued a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case . ''
A 1996 law named for him and Sen. Jesse Helms , R-N.C. , strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against Cuba .
Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington , it 's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought .
`` The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and this administration has not , which is his legal right and his right to due process , '' said Jorge Mas Santos , chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation .
`` This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to Cuba between now and Feb. 10 . ''
Earlier Friday , lawyers filed a petition on behalf of Elian 's great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez .
It is an attempt by his Miami relatives to get guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United States and asylum , said David Abraham , an immigration law professor at the University of Miami .
Neither the lawyers nor Elian 's relatives would comment before the judge 's ruling , which is expected early next week .
In Cuba , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return .
`` Elian , Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses , '' a Cuban country music band sang .
Also Friday , Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo , accompanied by one of the family 's lawyers , flew to Washington to appeal directly to Attorney General Janet Reno .
Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to reverse the INS order .
Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and the state court action .
`` I plan to respond as quickly as possible , '' she said in a statement .
Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it .
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing .
`` I believe they followed the law , '' Clinton said .
We need to keep this out of the political process as much as possible . ''
In contrast to Thursday , when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd , protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday .
However , the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience .
About 100 protesters marched in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday night , waving Cuban and American flags and chanting `` Cuba libre '' and `` long live the USA . ''
Two men carried a banner that said `` President Clinton , Please keep Elian in the United States . ''
Protesters planned a large demonstration in Little Havana on Saturday and were planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday .
`` If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court , all hell is going to break loose , '' said Jose Basulto , founder of Brothers to the Rescue , an anti-Castro group .
The rally in Cardenas , Cuba , was marked by songs , tears and personal recollections of Elian .
It was the most personal and emotional of many held since early December , when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the boy was returned to his father .
Elian 's father , his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang of the boy 's mother .
Gonzalez looked particularly distraught , his eyes red from crying .
During the day Friday , Elian played in his relatives ' yard with a puppy named Dolphin , a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart , R-Fla .
The black Labrador chased Elian around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts .
`` Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba , '' said Delfin Gonzalez , another of Elian 's great-uncles .
He said Elian wants his family to come here .
The grandmother of Elian Gonzalez said she is willing to go to Miami to bring the six-year-old boy home to Cuba , while Fidel Castro 's point man on U.S. relations expressed impatience at Washington 's failure to enforce a repatriation order .
In a massive demonstration demanding Elian 's return , tens of thousands of Cuban women -- hundreds visibly pregnant and others carrying small children -- marched along Havana 's seaside boulevard on Friday to the U.S. mission , waving Cuban flags and chanting `` Bring back our son ! ''
Elian 's young stepmother , Nelsy , flanked by his two grandmothers , was at the head of the `` March of the Combatant Mothers , '' pushing his half-brother in a stroller .
Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in the march .
The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December , when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba 's biggest gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought President Castro to power 41 years ago .
Elian , the boy at the center of the international dispute , was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother , stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores .
He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba .
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ruled that Elian must be returned to his father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , and set Friday as the deadline for his repatriation to Cuba .
But this week , Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian 's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy with them .
Ricardo Alarcon , president of the National Assembly and Castro 's point man on U.S. - Cuban relations , told The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are frustrated by Reno 's failure to set a new deadline and the INS 's failure to enforce its decision .
`` No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS , '' he said .
Alarcon , former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations , dismissed suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian 's relatives in Miami that Elian 's father travel from Cardenas , Cuba , to Miami to pick up the boy .
He said Cuba has not prohibited Gonzalez from going to Miami to retrieve Elian , American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have counseled against it .
`` We have gotten the same message from U.S. officials -- in private -- several times that it is not advisable for this man to appear in U.S. territory , '' said Alarcon .
The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes he will immediately become involved in political and legal problems that will prevent his speedy return .
Elian 's paternal grandmother , Mariela , told reporters that she was willing to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if it was assured to her that she could pick him up and return immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or political problems .
`` I would go there just for one minute to get him .
To get him .
Nothing more , '' she said .
Since his sea rescue , Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as `` our son , '' a boy hero symbolizing the government 's decades-long ideological battle with Cuban exiles in Miami .
Reno allowed the extension of the deadline after rejecting a Florida state court order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his American relatives .
Reno said the state court had no jurisdiction in the case , but that the Miami relatives should be able to make their case in federal court .
Elian 's paternal great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez , is fighting to keep the boy with him in Miami , saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba .
He and others who oppose the boy 's return to Cuba say that Elian 's mother died to give the boy freedom in the United States .
While state-run television broadcast footage of Cuban exiles protesting in Miami against the repatriation of Elian Gonzalez , the Cuban government urged its people to keep up their own demonstrations to ensure the boy 's return .
The unusual airing of protests against President Fidel Castro appeared aimed at warning Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still force the reversal of the U.S. government 's decision to return Gonzalez to Cuba .

Canadian authorities issued a nationwide arrest warrant Monday for James Charles Kopp , a U.S. fugitive on the FBI 's most wanted list for an alleged anti-abortion murder .
Kopp also is wanted for questioning in at least two other shootings of doctors who performed abortions .
The Canadian warrant issued Monday charged Kopp with attempted murder in the 1995 shooting of Dr. Hugh Short , who was wounded in the elbow but survived the attack at his home in Ancaster , Ontario .
`` It allows us to spread his name far and wide across Canada and say that he is wanted for attempted murder , '' said police Inspector Dave Bowen .
Kopp , who is from Vermont , was indicted last year in the October 1998 shooting death of Dr. Barnet Slepian , an obstetrician in Buffalo , New York .
He also is wanted in connection with the shooting of doctors in Winnipeg , Vancouver and Rochester , New York .
Slepian was killed by a single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a window of his home .
Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic , and the majority of jobs he has held over the past 20 years have been related to the anti-abortion movement , the U.S. Justice Department said last year .
He has been arrested more than a dozen times during abortion protests in seven states and Italy .
The FBI says Kopp has used 29 aliases .
He was the 456th person to be placed on the FBI 's most wanted list , which began in 1950 .
Since then , 427 fugitives have been taken into custody or located , 133 of them as a result of citizen assistance , the FBI said .
A total of $650,000 is being offered in the United States for information leading to Kopp 's arrest .
Calling the mother of Elian Gonzalez `` an excellent girl , '' President Fidel Castro said Friday she had been `` practically kidnapped '' by the boyfriend who perished along with her on the boat wreck her 6-year-old son survived .
Castro 's remarks to a conference of economists were aimed at those who say that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother sacrificed his life to take her to `` freedom , '' a vision he called a cliche .
He placed the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero , who apparently organized the ill-fated journey on which Elian 's mother Elisabeth Brotons and 10 other people -- including Munero -- died .
Castro called Munero -- who reportedly drove a taxi and engaged in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- a `` ruffian '' on whom Cuban police had amassed '' 100 pages of reports . ''
According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald , Munero had fled to Florida in June 1998 and returned to Cuba later that year , only to be jailed for several months .
`` The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy '' to make the late-November trip , Castro said .
The Cuban leader said Elian had been especially loved by his parents because the mother had earlier suffered seven miscarriages .
Earlier Friday , Cuba 's communist government celebrated the birth of independence hero Jose Marti on Friday with rallies calling for the return of Elian Gonzalez , the `` boy martyr '' at the center of an international custody battle .
Tens of thousands of children flooded Havana 's Plaza of the Revolution to deliver a dual homage to Marti and Elian , the 6-year-old Cuban whose rescue off Florida 's coast two months ago set off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits .
Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs , a string of young boys and girls recited poems they wrote for Elian , dubbed Cuba 's `` boy hero '' and `` symbolic child , '' and for Marti , commonly known on the island as Cuba 's `` teacher '' and `` apostle . ''
The Communist Party daily Granma compared Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto `` Che '' Guevara and said the boy `` has been converted forever into a symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent . ''
The commemorations were similar to those held here annually for Marti , the revolutionary and poet who fought for Cuba 's independence from Spain in 1898 .
But this year , children wore T-shirts bearing Elian 's portrait with their school uniforms .
The commemorations began early Friday morning , as tens of thousands of Cubans marched through Havana 's streets by torchlight .
Similar events were held all day in the capital and across the island .
In Old Havana , hundreds of children marched around the Parque Central chanting `` We will save Elian ! ''
A small group of girls wore construction paper handcuffs -- an apparent reference to the government 's characterization of Elian 's retention in the United States as a `` kidnapping . ''
Fidel Castro 's government has been using such traditional political events -- along with other rallies almost every day -- to draw attention to the case of Elian , who was rescued Nov. 25 while clinging to an inner tube .
His mother and 10 others died at sea while trying to reach the United States .
For the past two months , Elian 's father has demanded that the boy be returned to him in Cuba , and the U.S. government has said that father and son should be reunited .
But Elian 's paternal great-uncle in the United States , backed by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation , is fighting in the courts to keep the boy in Miami .
Cuba kept up its condemnation of the handling of Wednesday 's meeting between Elian and his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach , Fla .
Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said after the meeting she thought Elian should stay in the United States .
`` First Fruits of the Monstrousness , '' read the full-page editorial on the front of Friday 's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma .
It offered more details and criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian 's grandmothers , Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez , received from O'Laughlin , the Miami relatives and other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter .
In an interview with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN , Elian 's father also criticized how the meeting was handled .
He repeated charges that his relatives and others in Miami had offered him money to stay in the United States with his son .
`` They are not going to buy me , '' said Juan Miguel Gonzalez .
`` What is important for me is that they return the boy to me as soon as possible . ''
The Justice Department is reviewing whether alcohol-related driving violations or other actions by Elian Gonzalez' relatives in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a different , temporary custodian .
`` That matter is under review , '' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said when asked Thursday about the violations .
`` We will look at that , try to make some kind of factual determination and then decide what steps , if any , need to be taken . ''
In addition , the department is still considering a request last week from Elian 's father in Cuba , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , to have Elian 's temporary custody shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle , Manolo Gonzalez .
Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro Gonzalez 's family has permitted and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists selected by Lazaro Gonzalez 's family .
Meantime , the possibility of a meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno and Lazaro Gonzalez 's family reemerged Thursday .
Reno agreed to a meeting earlier this week , only to have Lazaro Gonzalez 's family withdraw the request .
But discussions have been renewed , a Justice official said Thursday .
Later Thursday , two of Elian 's Miami cousins sought support on Capitol Hill for legislation that would help keep the boy in America .
One of them , Marisleysis Gonzalez , told a news conference that reports of alcohol-related violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case .
`` We 're doing what 's in Elian 's best interest .
My family is a very close family , '' she said .
Another cousin , Georgina Cid , said Elian 's father had intended to flee Cuba himself , but was being coerced by the Castro government to stay and make certain statements .
`` He wanted to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba , '' Cid said .
She said she and other family members had spoken to Elian 's father by phone both before and after the mother perished .
The father 's response when learning that his boy was safe in Miami was `` take care of him until I can go , meaning go to the United States , '' Cid said .
A group of Florida lawmakers introduced legislation this month to grant Elian American citizenship , which would take the decision about Elian 's future away from INS and give it to a Florida family court .
Support for the bill has been waning .
Reno has already met with Lazaro Gonzalez 's lawyer and a Catholic nun from Miami who oppose his return to Cuba , as well as with Elian 's two grandmothers from Cuba , who want him returned .
In Havana , Elian 's father joined President Fidel Castro on Thursday in a packed auditorium in what has become a daily public rally to press for the boy 's return .
Speaker after speaker denounced the United States and extolled the virtues of Cuba 's communist revolution .
A Justice official , who requested anonymity , said the department has authority , if necessary , to shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro Gonzalez .
The boy was placed in his care after being found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people .
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of the father 's request that the boy be returned to him in Cuba , but that decision was put on hold while the Miami relatives battle in federal court to keep him in this country .
Holder said that INS acted appropriately but `` now that we have this new information , we 'll have to look at it , and see , like I said , what steps if any are appropriate . ''
Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez , 49 , was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997 .
Records also show Lazaro Gonzalez 's 62-year-old brother , Delfin Gonzalez , has been found guilty at least twice of driving under the influence .
On Wednesday , Ricardo Alarcon , head of Cuba 's National Assembly and Castro 's key man for U.S. - Cuban relations , said the convictions prove the homes of those uncles are no place for Elian .
`` Practically everyone surrounding him either has been , or may be in the future , joining the prison system in the U.S. That 's not the best interest of the child , '' Alarcon told reporters in Havana .
He said Elian was `` surrounded by two drunks . ''
Armando Gutierrez , a spokesman for the Miami relatives , dismissed the criticism : `` Elian is surrounded by love . ''
Elian 's relatives and other Miami supporters say his mother died to give him freedom .
The newspaper of Cuba 's Communist Party , daily Gramma , published a letter Thursday from Elian 's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking for Elian 's return .
`` No material good exists that can compete with the value of the family , and it is humiliating for us that people are still questioning our love and the future that awaits Elian at his home , '' said a Spanish version of the letter , dated Feb. 4 .
Elian Gonzalez 's father said in a letter published Wednesday that he wants Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet with his 6-year-old son in Miami and check on his condition .
`` We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping , '' Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote in a letter published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma .
`` We lack direct information about the concrete conditions to which he is subjected in his daily life . ''
It was likely to be opposed by Elian 's Miami relatives , who are fighting to keep the boy in the United States and who have said they think Gonzalez is being controlled by Fidel Castro 's government .
Gonzalez also wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this week , demanding that Elian be returned to him and saying he does not recognize the courts hearing the custody battle .
The Justice Department said it was reviewing that letter .
Gonzalez 's second letter to Reno in two weeks was published in Granma on Tuesday .
`` I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are arbitrarily retaining Elian , '' Gonzalez said in the letter , dated Monday .
In the letter , Gonzalez said he does not recognize the jurisdiction of theU.S. court system , which is weighing an attempt by Elian 's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba .
Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle since he was found on an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25 .
The boy 's mother and 10 other people died when their boat sank on the way from Cuba to the UnitedStates .
Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez , who is fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States .
Cuban exiles in Miami say the boy 's mother died to give him freedom in the United States , while theCuban government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father .
`` Juan Miguel must not have written the letter himself , '' said Armando Gutierrez , spokesman for Elian 's relatives in Miami .
`` Castro must be dreaming for the family to allow Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez 's home . ''
Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba without holding a political asylum hearing .
U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives ' lawsuit , arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy 's case .
The INS ruled last month that only Elian 's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration matters .
Elian Gonzalez 's father said in a letter published Wednesday that he wants Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet with his 6-year-old son in Miami and check on his condition .
`` We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping , '' Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote in a letter published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma .
`` We lack direct information about the concrete conditions to which he is subjected in his daily life . ''
It was likely to be opposed by Elian 's Miami relatives , who are fighting to keep the boy in the United States and who have said they think Gonzalez is being controlled by Fidel Castro 's government .
Hundreds of former fighters in the revolution that brought Castro to power 42 years ago gathered Wednesday night to denounce the Miami `` worms '' who support Elian 's being kept in the United States .
With Castro and other historic revolutionary leaders sitting in the front row of Havana 's Conventions Palace , a string of former guerrillas called for the return of `` our Elian '' to his father on the communist island .
Gonzalez had written a letter earlier this week to Attorney General Janet Reno , demanding Elian be returned to him and saying he did not recognize the courts hearing the custody battle .
The Justice Department said it was reviewing that letter .
Gonzalez 's second letter to Reno in two weeks was published in Granma on Tuesday .
`` I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are arbitrarily retaining Elian , '' Gonzalez said in the letter , dated Monday .
In the letter , Gonzalez said he does not recognize the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system , which is weighing an attempt by Elian 's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba .

The boy 's mother and 10 other people died when their boat sank on the way from Cuba to the United States .
Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez , who is fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States .
Cuban exiles in Miami say the boy 's mother died to give him freedom in the United States , while the Cuban government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father .
`` Juan Miguel must not have written the letter himself , '' said Armando Gutierrez , spokesman for Elian 's relatives in Miami .
`` Castro must be dreaming for the family to allow Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez 's home . ''
Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba without holding a political asylum hearing .
U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives ' lawsuit , arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy 's case .
The INS ruled last month that only Elian 's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration matters .
President Fidel Castro said Tuesday his government told U.S. officials it is worried that Miami-based exiles might take Elian Gonzalez to another country or even harm him if they lose their battle to block the boy 's return to Cuba .
Reading from Cuban intelligence documents on state television , Castro said a group of Cuban-Americans in Miami was studying the possibility of taking Elian and his Miami relatives to a third nation , probably Nicaragua or Costa Rica .
Castro said his government had shared its concerns with the U.S. State Department about the possibility of such a move '' which could cause damage not only to a child , but to the reputation of the United States . ''
A State Department duty officer said she had no information on a threat to Elian and was unaware of Castro 's remarks .
In Miami , the boy 's great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez , denied that he would send Elian out of the country , or that he himself would leave .
'' It never even entered my mind , '' he said .
The Cuban leader first raised those worries during another live television appearance Sunday night during a speech to about 700 Cuban university students .
But it was not until Tuesday that Castro revealed that those concerns had been shared directly with the U.S. government .
Tens of thousands of people paid tribute to the men who launched the Cuban Revolution more than four decades ago in a rally Saturday demanding the return of Elian Gonzalez .
With the historic yacht Granma towering behind him , Raul Castro , younger brother of President Fidel Castro and head of Cuba 's Revolutionary Armed Forces , likened the revolutionary battle to the fight for Elian , the 6-year-old boy at the center of an international custody battle .
'' Here , no one gives up ! ''
Castro declared .
The demonstrators , wearing T-shirts with Elian 's portrait , waved red , white and blue Cuban flags on the shore of the community of Niquero , where the Granma landed on Dec. 2 , 1956 , with 82 armed men led by Fidel Castro .
In the years that followed , the guerrilla fighters waged war on the troops of dictator Fulgencio Batista , declaring victory on Jan. 1 , 1959 when Batista fled the country .
Castro noted the importance that Cuba 's younger generations have played in the communist government 's battle to secure Elian 's return from the United States , where the boy 's Miami relatives are fighting for permanent custody .
As a father and the grandfather of eight children -- including a boy who just turned 6 , the same age as Elian -- Castro said he sympathized with the little boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez .
Gonzalez has cited his rights as the child 's sole surviving parent in his calls for his boy to be returned to him in communist Cuba .
Elian 's mother and 10 others perished when their boat sank off the coast of Florida in late November during a crossing from Cuba to the United States .
'' Elian today is the symbol of our unity , '' Castro said to cheers .
'' And our struggle will not end with the return of Elian , '' added Castro .
He said the Cuban people would continue to protest American laws and policies aimed at Cuba , including a four-decade economic embargo and continued U.S. military presence at the Guantanamo Naval Station on the easternmost end of the island .
In an apparent bid to show flexibility in the campaign to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba , President Fidel Castro said the boy 's father has offered to travel alone today to the United States to pick up his 6-year-old son .
However , a group trip with the boy 's relatives and classmates appeared more likely than a solo trip by his father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez .
Gonzalez , the boy 's stepmother , his baby half-brother , a dozen classmates and some adults planned to apply for American visas today at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana , the American mission here .
The group would be ready to leave for the United States as soon as Tuesday , Castro said .
Gonzalez said he would go get his son alone if U.S. authorities promised they would turn Elian over to him immediately and allow them to fly back to Cuba right away , Castro said Sunday .
'' I am willing to leave tomorrow , absolutely alone and transport myself to where the child is , '' Castro read from a letter signed by Gonzalez .
'' Only the government of the United States can decide if it prefers this variant , '' continued the letter , which Castro read on a state television station broadcast .
Gonzalez for months refused requests by Elian 's Miami relatives to go to the United States to claim the boy .
At the same time , the lawyers for the boy 's relatives in Miami said they might try to argue that his father is an unfit parent .
The White House has said there is no evidence of unfitness , and the father 's lawyer , Gregory Craig , said the '' outrageous '' allegations were a sign the Miami relatives were getting desperate .
It was unclear if American authorities would give the Cubans the 28 visas they have proposed .
The group would not leave until Gonzalez had assurances that American authorities would give him custody of his son .
The plan is for him and other members of the delegation to stay in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while awaiting the results of a federal court appeal by Elian 's Miami relatives , who have temporary custody of him and are seeking to block his return to Cuba .
In another dramatic move , Castro announced that the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington was willing to revoke the diplomatic immunity on his residence , where Cuba has proposed Gonzalez stay with Elian and the rest of his family during the federal appeal -- which could take as long as a month or two .
Castro said that if those who oppose returning Elian to Cuba are worried about turning the child over to '' what is considered Cuban territory , then our Interests Section is willing to renounce diplomatic immunity of the residence of the chief of this section in Washington . ''
Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November .
His mother was among 11 people who died after they boat sank during the attempted crossing from Cuba to the United States .
Elian 's Miami relatives are fighting to keep the boy in the United States , saying they can give him a better life off the communist island .
Gonzalez has demanded his rights as the child 's sole surviving parent and wants Elian returned to him .
In its latest deadline , the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has given the Miami relatives until 9 a.m .
Tuesday to sign a paper promising to turn over the boy to immigration authorities if they lose their federal court appeal .
The Miami relatives thus far have refused to sign the document , and in recent days said they would not turn Elian over to his father if he came to the United States .
Earlier , they had said they would give the boy to Gonzalez if he made the trip .
Before his Sunday night address , Castro played the affectionate grandfather to the 12 first-graders proposed to go on the trip , assuring them that their planned trip to Washington to retrieve their little friend was a very important mission .
Patting some of the kids on the head , Castro assured them that they formed a powerful '' commando . ''
'' Not even the Pentagon can handle these kids , '' he joked .
'' We are hoping that they get their visas . ''
President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night that it is just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited with his father .
'' I am talking about three days '' more or less , Castro told hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress .
'' The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms , in legal terms , in political terms , '' Castro said as he wound up his speech at Havana 's Karl Marx Theater .
Castro 's statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig , attorney for Elian 's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez , announced in Washington that the father would be traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife , their 6-month-old son , and with Fernando Remirez , chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington .
'' This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning ( 4 a.m. EDT Thursday ) , '' Castro said .
'' And I , at least , will be there to see him off . ''
He said the group would be met on arriving in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches , who traveled with Craig on his lightning trip to Havana on Wednesday .
The Cuban leader said that the U.S. government still did not know how it would transfer Elian to his father , but that it would happen quickly .
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier this week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States it will begin the process to transfer Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November .
The Miami kin has been battling to keep him in the United States , saying it can give him a better life off the communist island .
But Gonzalez , backed by Castro , has demanded his rights as Elian 's sole surviving parent and insisted that the child be returned to him .
Elian 's mother perished along with 10 others when their boat sank during the crossing from Cuba to the United States .
Since the tragedy , Elian has become a political poster boy for Cubans with diametrically opposed ideologies living on both sides of the Florida Straits .
During his speech Wednesday night , Castro expressed irritation that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted visas to travel to the United States to stay with Elian while waiting out a federal appeal filed by Elian 's Miami relatives and assist in his '' rehabilitation . ''
'' More important than the doctors are those 12 children '' from Elian 's first-grade class in Cuba , Castro said .
Cuba had asked for 28 visas for the trip , for Elian 's father , his stepmother , his little half-brother , a 5th grade boy cousin , the dozen classmates , and a host of teachers , doctors and other specialists .
Also on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon , who has served as adviser to Gonzalez over the past four months and a senior member of Cuba 's communist leadership .
Ultimately , U.S. officials approved and delivered six visas , for the four family members , a pediatrician and Elian 's teacher from his year in kindergarten .
After a weekend of bitter accusations lobbed by both sides of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle , attention returned today to the federal judges deciding a key point in the international case .
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been asked by the U.S. government to suspend a ruling by one of its judges that prevents the removal of Elian from the country .
Such a decision would allow the U.S. government to push for the 6-year-old boy 's swift reunion in Washington with his waiting father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , who wants to return to Cuba .
He has said he will wait out appeals by the Miami relatives seeking an asylum hearing for Elian before the same court -- but only if he has custody of his son .
There was growing apprehension outside the Little Havana home where the boy has lived with his great-uncle for nearly five months .
'' The feeling is the Clinton administration might send federal agents to pull him out of here , '' said Sergio Navarro , a 39-year-old Miami businessman who spent part of Sunday night with chanting protesters .
Elian 's relatives have cared for him since November , when he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits .
His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank .
The Clinton administration has pushed for the boy 's return to his father , ruling only he can speak for his son on immigration matters .
The boy 's Miami relatives say he will have a better life here and have attempted to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as a pawn of Fidel Castro .
The Justice Department wants the appeals court to suspend the temporary injunction issued Thursday and also order Elian 's great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez , to release the boy .
The relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian 's father without being required to surrender the boy .
The court watch comes after one of the most bitter charges yet in the custody battle .
Juan Miguel Gonzalez lashed out at his Miami relatives Sunday night , accusing them of '' child abuse '' for turning his son against him .
He said they have manipulated his son to believe that his mother still may show up someday -- in this country .
'' This is child abuse and mistreatment , what they 're doing to this boy , '' Gonzalez said on CBS 's '' 60 Minutes. '' '' The way they 're abusing him , turning him against his father ... he 's suffering more here amongst them than he suffered in the sea . ''
Gonzalez said he did n't believe a much-publicized video taped at the relatives ' home in which his son said he did n't want to go .
He has spoken with Elian at least three times since he arrived in the United States on April 6 , and he insisted his son wants to return to Cuba .
'' He 's told me so , '' Gonzalez said .
The Miami relatives are `` putting a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old .
He cannot decide for himself .
The one that decides for him is me , his father . ''
Elian 's Miami relatives have filed affidavits alleging Gonzalez abused his former wife and his 6-year-old son , a charge Gonzalez denied .
During the time of the broadcast on Sunday , family members and Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and did not publicly comment after the show .
Protesters , however , dismissed Juan Miguel 's comments as either selfish or the words of Fidel Castro .
'' Fidel Castro is claiming the son , not him , '' said Olga Coto , 56 , of Miami .
'' He 's being manipulated totally by Fidel Castro .
He 's not telling the truth . ''
Many worried their efforts to keep the boy in Miami would fail today , the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco , an aborted invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left much bitterness among the Cuban-American community .
'' We were betrayed by the government , by ( President ) Kennedy , and if they turned the child back over , it will be a second betrayal , '' said Josefa Gonzalez , who left Cuba in 1962 when she was 4 .
Earlier Sunday , protesters prayed for divine help as Easter week began , waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus .
Priests joined the crowd to offer a religious service .
'' There are many people who tell us that we should give up this fight , '' said Martin Anorga , an evangelical pastor .
'' But we will follow in the path that the Lord has shown us , despite those who want to get in our way . ''
The bombings at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have frightened away travelers from East Africa just as Kenya was hoping for an end to a years-old slump in foreign tourism , and as Tanzania was finally beginning to reap the benefits from a major investment in the travel industry .
Tour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and Tanzania , which boast some of Africa 's best game parks and sunniest beaches , say there have been no mass cancellations as a result of the Aug. 7 Embassy bombings in Nairobi , the Kenyan capital , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , which left more than 250 people dead .
But they report a number of worried calls from prospective travelers , many of them alarmed by the possibility of more terrorist attacks in the region .
`` People have been calling , and we 've been reassuring them that we do n't see further problems , '' said Mary Mkimbo , a spokeswoman in New York for the Kenya Tourist Office .
The State Department , which does not want to see Kenya and Tanzania punished economically as a result of terrorist attacks that were clearly targeted at the United States , has lifted dire travel warnings issued just the bombings that urged Americans to stay away from the two countries .
New public announcements put out on Aug. 13 suggest only that Americans `` exercise caution '' when visiting Kenya and Tanzania .
Embassy employees in both cities have gone back to work , although in new locations .
The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is expected to be demolished after the FBI has finished gathering evidence .
The embassy in Dar es Salaam suffered less damage from the blast , although it , too , may have to be razed .
For now , the State Department says , Embassy employees can offer only emergency consular service .
Western diplomats and intelligence officials say there is no reason to believe that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden , the exiled Saudi millionaire who is accused of organizing the Embassy bombings , plan to strike again soon in either country .
`` The tourism industry is very sensitive to the news media , '' said Ms. Mkimbo .
`` We do expect a little downward movement in the industry . ''
Tourism industry revenues reportedly dropped to $300 million last year , down from $450 million the year before .
The government has responded to the slump with a series of actions to lure tourists back , including a marked improvement in the service of Kenya Airways , the national airline , which has gone into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines .
The bombing will doubtless set back those efforts .
But the lack of infrastructure has worked to Tanzania 's advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number of adventure travelers who are willing , even eager to go without the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers .
The number of visitors to Tanzania jumped from fewer than 100,000 in 1980 to more than 300,000 last year , prompting the government to improve roads needed for safari tours .
`` Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for years , and they 're beginning to develop it now , '' said Jalal Ebrahim , president of Safaricentre International , a tour operator in Manhattan Beach , Calif .
Ebrahim , whose company has been sending American travelers on East African safaris for 13 years , said that his company had received only one cancellation as a result of the embassy bombings _ and that he did not expect many more .
`` We had one cancellation from a couple who decided they were just going to wait and see what happened , '' he said .
They read a lot , they stay on top of world events . ''
They understand , he said , that increasingly terrorism knows no borders .
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday , Oct. 26 :
The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk their safety to perform legal abortions in this country .
Slepian was one of only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo , N.Y. , area , and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion groups had become routine over the past decade .
He persevered through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose whether to bear a child .
But a principled commitment to provide a constitutionally protected service could not stop the assassin 's bullet that tore through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night .
His death shows again how tentative the right to abortion has become in the face of terrorism by anti-choice fanatics .
Their repeated acts of terrorism must be met with the severest possible crackdown by law-enforcement authorities .
If an armed police officer has to be stationed outside every abortion provider 's home and office , 24 hours a day , let it be done .
Last week the FBI joined Canadian authorities to investigate a series of unsolved sniper shootings of doctors in Canada and western New York dating to 1994 .
In January , a week after the 25th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision , a clinic bombing in Birmingham , Ala. , killed a security guard and severely wounded a nurse .
Since 1993 , three doctors , including Slepian , three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been murdered .
There have been more than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers in the last five years .
Arson and bombings at clinics have become so common that many no longer make the national news .
It is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures are working to dismantle reproductive rights by banning certain procedures , such as so-called partial birth abortion , and by requiring waiting periods and parental consent before an abortion can be obtained .
But those restrictions are at least imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicial struggle in a democracy .
What is outrageous is the attempt to shut down abortions by illegal means _ by shooting the doctors or bombing the clinics or harassing the women seeking to exercise their constitutional right .
Some anti-abortion groups , to their credit , have denounced the bombings and shootings , but others seem reluctant to issue the strong condemnations that are warranted .
Indeed , one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site lists the names of doctors it says perform abortions , or `` crimes against humanity , '' with a code indicating whether they are `` working , '' `` wounded '' or a `` fatality . ''
Such incendiary rhetoric , and frequent accusations by some anti-abortionists that abortion providers are committing murder , can only fuel more terrorism .
The increase of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns of harassment by protest groups , even short of murder , have worked to make abortions harder to obtain .
More than 80 percent of counties in this country have no abortion provider .
In 45 states , the number of doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992 .
Slepian was among those who took a stand against restricting reproductive freedom and paid with his life .
Unless these brave doctors are better protected , fewer doctors in the next generation will be willing to place themselves and their families in such danger .
That is what the terrorists want .
They must not be allowed to succeed .
Additional details of the slaying emerged on Sunday .
Slepian 's lawyer , Glenn Edward Murray , said the sniper 's bullet entered through a partially draped kitchen window , hit Slepian in the back and exited through his chest .
The doctor 's wife and one of his sons were in the kitchen when the shooting occurred , Murray said .
The bullet bounced off a cabinet and ricocheted into the living room , where the doctor 's three other children were watching television , Murray said .
Slepian 's wife and one son tried to revive him .
Just over an hour later , he was declared dead at nearby Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital .
For the most part , people on both sides of the abortion issue expressed outrage at the shooting .
But one abortion opponent , the Rev. Donald Spitz , the founder of Pro-Life Virginia , described Slepian 's killer as a `` hero '' for ending the physician 's `` bloodthirsty practice . ''
`` We as Christians have a responsibility to protect the innocent from being murdered , '' Spitz said in a statement released to The Associated Press , `` the same way we would want someone to protect us .
Whoever shot the shot protected the children . ''
Most other opponents of abortion , however , condemned the shooting and abortion .
In his Sunday Mass at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York , Cardinal John O'Connor called the murder wrong but he urged those angered by the slaying to be equally angered by abortions .
`` He called on many of the same people to express outrage at partial birth abortion , which he called the equivalent of infanticide , '' Joseph Zwilling , a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York , said of the cardinal 's sermon .
Religious leaders in Buffalo also condemned the shooting .
Bishop Henry Mansell of the Archdiocese of Buffalo said it was `` an act of madness , '' but he went on to defend the Church 's opposition to abortion as `` respecting of human life in all its forms , especially the most vulnerable . ''
Susan Dudley , deputy director of the National Abortion Federation , assailed the remarks and called on anti-abortion groups to shift their tactics .
She said the rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement has helped lead to violent attacks against abortion providers .
`` I think that when pro-life organizations try to distinguish between themselves and these incidents they are at best being disingenuous , '' she said .
`` They are the ones who call these doctors murderers . ''
In Amherst , residents who said they opposed abortion decried the attack and said they hoped the perpetrator was caught .
Men smoking cigars and drinking beer with friends after shooting skeet at the Buffalo Shooting Club in Amherst said their feelings about abortion were mixed , but they uniformly denounced the killing of Slepian .
Many residents said abortion had gradually dwindled as a local issue since Operation Rescue , an anti-abortion group , started a series of largely unsuccessful `` Spring of Life '' demonstrations in 1992 intended to shut down abortion clinics and harass local doctors , including Slepian .
Little of the vitriol that the issue aroused in the late 1980s and early 1990s remains , residents said , and many of the local religious leaders who led the 1992 protests have moved .
`` The only people that are left are the hard-core , fanatical people , '' said Larry Finkelstien , a high school teacher who works as an escort at abortion clinics .
`` Everyone else has gone away . ''
The killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian , a gynecologist in Buffalo who performed abortions , has become a factor in at least two campaigns in New York , say political consultants and some campaign advisers .
In the race for attorney general , the Democratic candidate , Eliot Spitzer , who favors abortion rights , has moved quickly to make the anti-abortion position of his opponent , Attorney General Dennis Vacco , a central issue in the campaign .
And in the tight race for U.S. Senate , while the Democrat , Charles Schumer , another abortion-rights supporter , has not raised Slepian 's death himself , his aides say it puts a new emphasis on the issue .
Slepian was shot in the back on Friday night as he stood in his kitchen .
No suspects have been identified .
Even before the killing , Schumer was tyring to draw more attention to the anti-abortion record of his opponent , Senator Alfonse D'Amato , a Republican who is also running on the Right to Life Party line .
In a New York Times / CBS News poll completed on Saturday , 69 percent of those polled said they did not know D'Amato 's position on abortion , and only 19 percent knew that he opposed abortion rights .
Now events are doing the work for Schumer .
Slepian 's death was among the first topics raised in Saturday night 's debate between the two men , and it was instantly followed by a question to D'Amato on whether he opposed first-trimester abortions for adult women .
On Tuesday , the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League plans to hold a news conference to screen a television advertisement _ made last week , before Slepian died _ featuring Emily Lyons , a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year in the bombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama .
The advertisement , said Kelli Conlin , the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral , is intended to spotlight D'Amato 's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act , which Schumer sponsored .
The measure made it a Federal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic .
Now , Ms. Conlin said , it will have new resonance , and the organization is considering buying more air time .
`` It 's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been regardless , '' she said .
`` But sensitivities are so heightened from the shooting in western New York that it 's even more powerful . ''
David Eichenbaum , a Democratic political consultant who is not working for anyone in this year 's campaign , said abortion `` is no longer the driving issue it once was , at least on the pro-choice side . ''
But , Eichenbaum said : `` Sometimes an incident like this will do more to energize those who are pro-choice who otherwise might not consider that as an important an issue to go to the polls over .
It brings it home . ''
D'Amato 's aides would not comment about the political ramifications of the slaying , and Schumer 's aides would not talk about whether they planned to refer to it in any advertisements , or whether the candidate planned to use it on the campaign trail .
`` Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree this was a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy , '' said Josh Isay , Schumer 's campaign manager .
But , Isay added , `` it heightens the abortion issue . ''
Steven Goldstein , the campaign spokesman for Spitzer , was less reticent .
`` Eliot is going to make a huge priority of this , '' Goldstein said .
`` Stopping clinic violence is going to be a major theme of our campaign from now to Election Day . ''
In Sunday 's debate against Vacco , Spitzer attacked him for failing to enforce a court order in 1992 against anti-abortion protesters who had blocked the entrance to a clinic .
It was the same clinic where Slepian worked .
A federal judge removed Vacco , then the U.S. attorney for western New York , from the case .
He was replaced with two special prosecutors .
Spitzer also criticized Vacco for dismantling the Office of Reproductive Rights , which investigated threats and crimes against abortion clinics , when he became attorney general .
On Monday , Spitzer called for Vacco to revive that unit immediately , vowing that he would do so on his first day in office if elected .
Goldstein , who said it was `` thoroughly , thoroughly possible '' that the issue would surface in Spitzer 's advertisements , defended the use of the issue by noting that the attorney general has direct impact on the issue of clinic access .
Vacco 's campaign manager , Matt Behrmann , said in a statement that Spitzer had `` sunk to a new and despicable low by attempting to capitalize on the murder of a physician in order to garner votes . ''
`` It 's possible that New York politics has never seen anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer 's willingness to exploit the unfortunate murder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions , '' Berhrmann said .
Several consultants agreed that there might be political hay to be made in Slepian 's death but that it had to be done carefully .
`` Trying to score political points from a homicide can have a backlash , '' said Maureen Connelly , a media consultant not working for any candidate in next week 's election .
The antiabortion activist wanted for questioning in last month 's shooting death of a doctor in a Buffalo suburb may have fled to Mexico , according to a newspaper report .
James Charles Kopp , 44 , of Vermont , was seen in the car of a female associate crossing the US border days after a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his kitchen , the Buffalo News reported Friday .
Kopp has been the subject of a manhunt following reports that he was spotted in a vehicle near the scene of the Oct. 23 slaying of Slepian , 52 , an obstetrician who also performed abortions .
The FBI says Kopp is wanted as a material witness in the case .
Friday , an FBI official said authorities are pursuing more than 400 tips but have not pinned down Kopp 's whereabouts .
`` In all candor , the FBI does not know where James Kopp is _ period , '' said Paul Moskal , a spokesman for the bureau 's Buffalo office .
`` He 's as likely to be in Boston , Massachusetts , as in Buffalo , New York . ''
Authorities want to question the unidentified woman who allegedly traveled with Kopp , according to an investigator quoted by the newspaper .
`` She may have been with Kopp sometime after the murder , '' the investigator said .
President Bill Clinton Saturday vowed to hunt down and bring to justice those who were responsible for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
" No matter how long it takes or where it takes us , we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved and justice is done , " Clinton said in his weekly radio address .
" To turn our backs on those taking risks for peace , to weaken our opposition to terrorism -- that would give terrorism a victory it must not and will not have , " the president said .
The Friday explosions at U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar-es-Salaam , Tanzania , killed at least 110 people , and the number injured topped 2,200 .

The State Department has sent medical and other supplies as well as investigators to the two countries .
The FBI also dispatched dozens of agents and bombing and evidence specialists there .
Aircraft have taken off from the United States , Europe and elsewhere in Africa bearing medical suplies and other equipment , along with replacement personnel for the two embassies .
A 62-member rescue team , previously sent to the bombed-out federal building in Oklahoma City , Okla. , was en route to Nairobi .
U.S. embassies and military installations around the world were ordered to set up barriers and tighten security systems to prevent easy access by unauthorized people -- Americans and foreigners .
The Cypriot government Saturday strongly condemned two terrorist bomb attacks in Kenya and Tanzania Friday , calling them an " atrocious crime . "
In a condolence telegram to U.S. President Bill Clinton , President Glafcos Clerides condemned the terrorist acts and extended his sympathy to the victims ' families .
Similar telegrams were sent by the Cyprus government to the presidents of Kenya and Tanzania .
More than 100 people have died , eight of them Americans and over 1,000 injured since a bomb ripped through an office building next to the U.S. embassy in Nairobi , Kenya Friday morning .

No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks .
The Cuban government Friday condemned the two bomb explosions near U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Cuban government is against such kind of terrorist attacks , which pose potential threats to every country .
The Cuban government also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims .

More than 100 people have been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded in the blasts next to the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday .
No one has claimed responsibility .
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that she was heartened by cooperation from Kenya and Tanzania in probing into last Friday 's bombings of U.S. embassies .
" I have been heartened by the close cooperation we have had with authorities in Kenya and Tanzania from the moment the tragedies occurred , " Albright told ambassadors and charges d'affaires of 30 African countries in Washington , who came to the State Department to offer condolences .
" I want to thank you for the help that your governments have provided by sharing information and tightening security at our embassies in recent days , " she said .
The bombings at U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have killed more than 200 people , including 12 Americans , and wounded over 5,000 .
The United States has dispatched FBI agents to Africa to investigate the bombings but there was no word in Washington on Tuesday of any significant leads so far .
Tanzanian police said on Tuesday they had arrested 14 foreigners in their search for bombers .
The 14 foreigners , six Iraqis , six Sudanese , a Somali national and a Turk , were rounded up because they failed to explain their presence in the country satisfactorily .
Albright announced on Monday to offer a reward of up to 2 million U.S. dollars for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bombers .
She told African envoys that she looked forward to visiting Kenya and Tanzania but would wait until she could do so without placing undue burdens on the heavily stretched U.S. embassies there .
She also said the bombings would not prevent the United States from building " a strong new relationship with a new Africa . "
Egyptian Ambassador Ahmed Maher el-Sayed , on behalf of the African envoys , condemned the " cowardly , criminal and tragic " bombings .
" Terrorism is inconsistent with our African history , our tradition , our culture and our beliefs , " he said .
" Americans and Africans need to strengthen their cooperation in this universal battle " against terrorism .
President Bill Clinton Thursday condemned terrorist bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed to find the bombers and bring them to justice .
" No matter what it takes , we must find those responsible for these evil acts and see that justice is done , " Clinton said at the ceremony marking the return of remains of Americans who were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing .
The ceremony was held at Andrews Air Force Base , near Washington , where 10 of 12 American victims of the Kenya embassy bombing were brought back by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
Clinton said the United States will not retreat from the world because of terrorist attacks .
Albright , echoing the president , said the United States would " continue to be present around the world , wherever we have interests to defend . "
`` She may have been with Kopp sometime after the murder , '' the investigator said .
`` Kopp may be in Mexico .
He may have even traveled further into Central America or South America . ''
A task force of US and Canadian officials is investigating the similarities between the attack on Slepian and four others on abortion providers in Canada and upstate New York in the past four years .
The US Justice Department is offering a $500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Slepian 's slaying .
The FBI has interviewed and released one of two men who were sought last week for questioning in connection with the sniper slaying of a doctor in the Buffalo , N.Y. , area who performed abortions .
The two men , Ronald Stauber and Michael Gingrich , were named Thursday in a bulletin sent by the FBI office in Cleveland to police departments across the country .
The men were not termed suspects , and FBI officials on Saturday played down the likelihood that either was involved in the Oct. 23 killing of the doctor , Barnett Slepian .
`` We are doing dozens if not hundreds of interviews a day , '' said Paul Moskal , a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo .
`` I know of no information that would treat these two differently or would put them in any other category from the hundreds of leads we 're investigating on a daily basis . ''
Moskal said one of the two men _ he said he did not know which one _ had been located , interviewed and released .
In its Friday issue , The Hamilton ( Ontario ) Spectator quoted an officer in the Amherst , N.Y. , Police Department as saying that the FBI. bulletin had indicated possible links between the two men and James Charles Kopp , an abortion opponent who is being sought as a material witness in the case .
Amherst police officials declined to comment Saturday .
Slepian , 52 , an obstetrician and gynecologist , was shot through the kitchen window of his home in Amherst shortly after he and his wife returned home from synagogue on the night of Friday , Oct. 23 .
He was one of three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo area .
Investigators in Canada and the United States are also looking into four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and western New York .
Moskal said the two men apparently showed up at Slepian 's house the day after his death .
They were trying to attend a prayer vigil for Slepian but had been sent to his house by mistake , and a police officer on duty took their names , Moskal said .
`` They were being sought for interviews just because they were literally in the area after the homicide , '' he said .
FBI officials said they were not certain whether Stauber or Gingrich had been involved in antiabortion activities .
The two men are believed to live in the Cleveland area .
Inspector Keith MacCaskill of the Winnipeg Police Service , a Canadian member of a law-enforcement task force investigating all five of the shootings , said he had never heard of the men .
Moskal emphasized that no one has been named as a suspect in Slepian 's death .
`` Just the fact that we are interviewing anyone does n't make them a subject or a suspect in this , '' he said .
INDEPENDENCE , Mo. _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization embraced three of its former rivals , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland on Friday , formally ending the Soviet domination of those nations that began after World War II and opening a new path for the military alliance .
In a ceremony tinged with the personal and the emotional at the Truman Presidential Library here , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright watched the foreign ministers of the three countries sign the documents of accession to the alliance , signed them herself and then held them aloft like a victory trophy .
Albright , who was born in Prague and fled just after the Communist takeover in 1948 , made no secret of her joy at her homeland and its neighbors joining the alliance after a six year trans-Atlantic diplomatic process led by the Clinton administration .
`` To quote an old Central European expression , ` Hallelujah , ''' she said .
In Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , the moment was marked by small-scale public celebrations .
In Warsaw , Poland , after dark , as fireworks lit the sky , the Polish flag and the flag of NATO were raised side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pilsudski Square
In Hungary , NATO members ' flags were raised outside the Defense Ministry .
And in Prague , Czech Republic , President Vaclav Havel said in a statement , `` Never have we been part of such a broad , solid and binding security alliance which at the same time respects in its essence the sovereignty and will of our nation . ''
The enlargement of NATO from 16 members to 19 has been one of the administration 's foremost foreign policy goals , one that grew out of a desire , its proponents said , to cement the democratic gains made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after the collapse of communism 10 years ago .
But the policy also faced critics , who argued that welcoming these three new countries would draw a new line across Europe and antagonize the Russians .
As of Friday , the border between Western Europe and the former Soviet Union moved to the eastern border of Poland .
In her speech , in the small auditorium where dignitaries from the three countries sat and the three foreign ministers flanked her on the stage , Albright countered that NATO would now do `` for Europe 's East what NATO has already helped to do for Europe 's West .
" We will do all we can to protect our diplomatic and military peoples around the world , " she said .
Clinton met with his top aides Wednesday in the White House to assess the situation following the twin bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , which have killed more than 250 people and injured over 5,000 , most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians .
Twelve Americans were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing .
Clinton ordered an assessment of what it would cost to rebuild the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the price tag for emergency response teams sent to the two countries .
He also asked for a " list of the priorities for improving security for U.S. facilities around the world . "
The State Department and the Office of Management and Budget will jointly make the assessments " in the next few days , " and the president will present the report to Congress for more emergency funding .
Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) Louis Freeh said here Friday that U.S. air raid on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked with the probe into the August 7 bombings in east Africa .
" This is an investigation proceeding on many fronts , " said Freeh at a press conference at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before returning home .
" I cannot detail or characterize the type of evidence we have gathered in Nairobi . "
He said he cannot confirm there is any evidence linking the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S. terrorism , Osama Bin Laden , who now lives in Afghanistan .
" Hundreds of people have been interviewed " and investigators probably have to take quite a long time to compile evidence in the two bomb blasts so as to reach any conclusion , he said .
Freeh flew to Washington immediately after the press conference .
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he had ordered the strikes after receiving " convincing evidence " that the terrorist facilities the U.S. raided in Sudan and Afghanistan had played key roles in the bomb attacks in capitals of Kenya and Tanzania .
However , Freeh said although the bombing investigators from the FBI , Kenya and Tanzania have been working very hard and made " very good progress " on the case , so far no conclusion or decision can be made at this stage .
After touring Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday and meeting with Kenyan police leaders Friday morning , the FBI chief also said that he is very satisfied with the close and effective cooperation among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and Tanzania .
The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S. embassy here seconds before the bomb exploded was positively identified Thursday as two more suspects -- one Arab , one Sudanese -- who had been arrested , Kenya 's national newspapers reported Friday .
Local sources said that the plan of bombing U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda .
A senior government official who saw the confessions of suspects was quoted Friday by local media as saying that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group , linked with Laden , planned the attacks .
The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed 253 people and injured 5,000 others .
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others .
Earlier , the U.S. 's demand for Laden 's extradition from Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government .
The ratification process of NATO enlargement concluded on Wednesday after the Netherlands gave its go-ahead .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic have been accepted as members of the Western military alliance after the upper house of the Dutch parliament voted in favor of their inclusion .
All the political parties in the upper house , with the exception of the Greens , agreed on the enlargement process , according to reports reaching here .
The lower house already approved the enlargement move in early October this year .
The ratification process began in February this year with Canada being the first NATO member state starting the ratification process .
It was followed by Denmark , Norway , Germany , France , Greece , Luxembourg , Spain , Britain , the United States , Iceland , Belgium , Italy , Portugal and Turkey .
NATO decided at last year 's Madrid summit to invite the three eastern European countries to start accession talks .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic are scheduled to become full members of NATO in April next year when the alliance celebrates its 50th anniversary in Washington .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) has decided to admit Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic in early March , an official from the organization said on Wednesday .
The official said that the accession was planned for early March , but no exact date was fixed yet .
He added that a ceremonial accession would still be held at the NATO Washington summit on April 24 and 25 .
The March accession will enable the three countries to be eligible for signing the summit documents that will include the alliance 's new strategic concept and post-Madrid development plan , the official added .
The western military alliance invited the three central and eastern European countries to join the 16-nation bloc in July 1997 at the Madrid summit .
The three countries have finished all necessary formalities for accession after the Hungarian parliament ratified the accession treaty on Tuesday .
Also applying for NATO membership are Romania , Slovenia , Latvia , Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
The presidents of Poland and the Czech Republic have signed papers of accession in simultaneous ceremonies -- broadcast live on Polish television in Warsaw and Prague -- to become members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) .
Poland 's Aleksander Kwasniewski and Vaclav Havel signed the preparatory documents in their presidential palaces .
Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz and other senior military officers were also present at the ceremony .
Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary , who were invited to join NATO in Madrid in July 1997 , will officially join NATO on March 12 in a ceremony in Independence , Missouri .
Hungarian head of state Arpad Goencz signed Budapest 's accession document on February 10 .
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has invited Polish Foreign Minister Bronisaw Geremek to visit the United States .
In her speech , in the small auditorium where dignitaries from the three countries sat and the three foreign ministers flanked her on the stage , Albright countered that NATO would now do `` for Europe 's East what NATO has already helped to do for Europe 's West .
Steadily and systematically , we will continue erasing _ without replacing _ the line drawn in Europe by Stalin 's bloody boot . ''
Albright also used her speech to articulate a forward-looking vision for NATO , which will celebrate its 50th anniversary in Washington next month , and to defend NATO 's potential involvement in Kosovo .
In the aftermath of the Cold War , she said , NATO must be ready to face `` an aggressive regime , a rampaging faction , or a terrorist group .
And we know that if , past is prologue , we face a future in which weapons will be more destructive at longer distances than ever before . ''
The NATO summit , she said , would produce an initiative that `` responds to the grave threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery . ''
In Kosovo , where the Yugoslav leader , Slobodan Milosevic , is resisting the deployment of NATO-led troops , including 4,000 U.S. soldiers , Albright insisted that NATO was the best tool to enforce a peace settlement .
`` We must be clear in explaining that a settlement without NATO-led enforcement is not acceptable because only NATO has the credibility and capability to make it work , '' she said .
`` And we must be resolute in spelling out the consequences of intransigence , '' she added , referring to the threat of NATO air strikes against Milosevic if he does not agree to the deployment .
But in many ways , the day belonged to the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland , who in order to meet NATO 's standards have had to cut the size of their Soviet-style militaries , organize civilian control of their armies and agree to buy NATO compatible equipment in the coming years .
It was the spiritual homecoming to the West that all three foreign ministers stressed .
`` Poland forever returns where she has always belonged _ the free world , '' said Bronislaw Geremek , the foreign minister of Poland , who was a dissident during the Communist era .
Geremek said he had brought some appropriate mementoes from Poland to the Truman library , including a campaign poster from 1989 when the anti-communist Solidarity forces won against the Communists .
The poster showed a picture of Gary Cooper from the film `` High Noon . ''
`` It helped us to win , '' Geremek said .
`` For the people of Poland , high noon comes today . ''
The Czech foreign minister , Jan Kavan , who lived in London from 1968 , when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia , until 1989 , said he had remained buoyant during his opposition work as an emigre by believing that communism would eventually fall .
But he never dreamed , he said , that his country would become a member of NATO .
`` Accession to NATO is a guarantee that we will never again become powerless victims of any foreign aggression , '' Kavan said .
Similarly , the Hungarian foreign minister , Janos Martonyi , who remembers the 1956 uprising as a 13-year-old , said that membership of NATO meant that Hungary was returning `` to her natural habitat . ''
`` It has been our manifest destiny to rejoin those with whom we share the same values , interests and goals , '' he said .
But Martonyi also emphasized that Hungary understood NATO membership carried with it obligations as well as privileges .
`` We shall prove that new members can indeed add to the weight of the alliance , '' he said .
The location for Friday 's ceremony was chosen by Albright , who as secretary of state is the depository of NATO 's accession accords .
The secretary made the fairly unorthodox decision to choose a site outside Washington because she wanted the ceremony to resonate with the memories of President Truman , under whom NATO was founded .
On April 4 , 1949 , on behalf of the United States , Truman 's secretary of state , Dean Acheson , signed the Washington Treaty , which created NATO .
Acheson is Albright 's favorite predecessor , her aides said .
Formed in reaction to the threat of the Soviet Union under Stalin , NATO calls for the collective defense of its members and was brought into being with an original 12 members .
The alliance has expanded three times before , adding Greece and Turkey in 1952 , West Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982 .
But never before has NATO reached out to its former Eastern-bloc enemies .
The Clinton administration embarked on the expansion of NATO in 1993 after Clinton met in Washington with President Havel and Lech Walesa , who was then the president of Poland .
These conversations are remembered by Clinton 's foreign policy team because they took place after the opening of the Holocaust Museum and because they involved two very different Central European leaders who brought the same message .
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has invited Polish Foreign Minister Bronisaw Geremek to visit the United States .
He will then travel to Washington DC on March 12 to submit the document .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic Friday formally joined NATO at a ceremony held in the city of Independence , Missouri .
At the Harry Truman Library in Independence , the three foreign ministers of Bronislaw Geremek of Poland , Janos Martonyi of Hungary and Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic signed formal documents of accession .
In speeches before the signing ceremony , the ministers said their countries saw NATO membership as an assurance of security and recognition of their rightful place in Europe .
Kavan said the Czech Republic would no longer become " the powerless victim of a foreign invasion . "
Martonyi called Hunragy 's admission in NATO " returning to her natural habitat , " saying : " It has been our manifest destiny to rejoin those with whom we share the same values , interests and goals . "
And Geremek said it was " a great day for Poland and for the world . "
Hungary 's accession to NATO has brought about new changes to the political balance in central and eastern Europe , shattering the world configuration under the Yalta accord since World War II , Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said here Friday .
Addressing a NATO flag-lowering ceremony at the Dutch embassy , Orban said the occasion indicated the end of the embassy 's mission of liaison between Hungary and NATO ( North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) .
The Hungarian government staged a number of celebrations to mark the country 's entry into NATO on Friday .
In a televised address Friday , President Arpad Gencz described the entry as " a historic event " which proves the credibility and the realistic approaches of the country 's foreign policy .
Among the first three former Warsaw Pact countries to accede to NATO on Friday were also Poland and the Czech Republic .
The ambassadors of Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic issued a joint statement Friday saying the three countries ' entry into NATO will consolidate Europe 's security and help eliminate threats to it .
Five major political parties in the country issued statements supporting the country 's NATO membership .
But some other parties and social organizations are against NATO 's expansion , claiming Hungary 's accession to NATO would be detrimental to the country 's independence and bring about new problems and economic burdens to the country .
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic Friday formally joined NATO at a ceremony held in the city of Independence , Missouri .
At the Harry Truman Library in Independence , the three foreign ministers of Bronislaw Geremek of Poland , Janos Martonyi of Hungary and Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic signed formal documents of accession .
In speeches before the signing ceremony , the ministers said their countries saw NATO membership as an assurance of security and recognition of their rightful place in Europe .

And Geremek said it was " a great day for Poland and for the world . "
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted admission papers from the three countries ' foreign ministers , marking their formal entry into the 50-year-old Western alliance .
" Hallelujah , " exclaimed Albright , a daughter of Czechoslovakia , who as a child fled her native land and later became a U.S. citizen .
Ahead of the ceremony , NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that the accession of the three countries ... " is perhaps the clearest demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing closer together . "
" Extending membership to these three democracies helps to stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground for many of the disasters of this century , " Solana added , referring to the two world wars .
The U.S. State Department has said the three new members " enhance NATO 's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense , respond to a range of security challenges and reduce the possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has claimed so many American lives . "
Their message was that NATO should be used as the mechanism to secure the democratic progress of their countries and at the same dissuade Russia from any more imperial designs .
The U.S. ambassador to Poland , Dan Fried , who was then on the National Security Council , said Friday that he remembered being asked to help `` turn this pious wish into a policy . ''
In July 1997 , at a summit in Madrid , Spain , the alliance announced it would accept Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic .
Romania and Slovenia , which had tried hard to meet the standards , were turned away , at least for the time being .
One problem was how to deal with the Russians , who vacillated between outright hostility and accepting what looked like the inevitable .
In early 1997 , President Boris Yeltsin told President Clinton he could live with NATO expansion .
But in order to accommodate the Russians , NATO created the NATO-Russia Council as a consultative body that formalized relations between Moscow and the alliance .
Poland has been sensitive to the reactions of Russia to its membership of NATO , and Geremek has gone out of his way to reassure the Russians .
`` We want our membership of NATO to serve as a ` catalyst' for Polish Russian co-operation , '' he said last year .
Even so , on the secretary of state 's plane carrying Albright and the three foreign ministers to the ceremony Friday , the ministers were asked whether they could ever foresee Russia as a member of NATO .
Then Martonyi replied : `` Silence is your answer . ''
With the finding of a buried rifle 11 days ago , the authorities in the Buffalo , N.Y. , area say they have gathered enough evidence in the October slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian to begin presenting a murder case to a state grand jury as early as next week .
A federal grand jury has already been addressing the slaying under laws that prohibit violence against providers of abortion .
Slepian was the mainstay of Buffalo 's only abortion clinic before he was shot to death last Oct. 23 at his home in suburban Amherst .
But the decision by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to begin presenting evidence to a state grand jury suggests that he has amassed enough material to support a criminal indictment for homicide .
`` We 've gotten to the point where we know what we want to introduce before a grand jury , '' Clark said in a telephone interview Monday .
Although the authorities are not saying who the suspect is , all of the attention so far has fallen on James C. Kopp , a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester who had been traveling around the country from demonstration to demonstration for years .
Officially , Kopp is being sought as a `` material witness '' in the case .
Clark said it was easier to seek extradition of an indicted suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone wanted as a material witness .
For now , though , that would be a theoretical advantage since the authorities have admitted they have no idea where Kopp is .
Clark said there was `` no question '' that the finding of the rifle was important in his decision to seek an indictment .
The rifle was discovered April 8 buried one foot below the ground , about 200 feet behind Slepian 's house .
It is undergoing testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington , but the authorities have said it resembles the kind of high-powered rifle used in the slaying .
Clark said other evidence that prosecutors might present includes a strand of human hair found at the wooded firing site that has a `` high likelihood '' of matching Kopp 's hair and testimony from a jogger who spotted Kopp 's car near Slepian 's house at 6 a.m. ten days before the shooting .
There also are videotapes of Kopp 's car crossing the Canadian border around the days _ in 1994 , 1995 and 1997 _ that three Canadian doctors who perform abortions were shot at .
None of those doctors were killed .
If a suspect is caught and charged in both state and federal courts , a state trial would likely precede a federal one , giving the authorities two chances to prosecute .
New York State double-jeopardy laws would make it difficult to prosecute a suspect who had been found not guilty at a federal trial .
U.S. Attorney Denise E. O'Donnell declined to discuss what federal charges were being pursued , but she said that in a case like this , potential charges would be abortion-related violence , the use of a firearm in an act of violence , crossing state lines to commit a crime , and , if the suspect 's act was tied to an organization , violation of the so-called RICO statutes , which prohibit an organized criminal enterprise .
Slepian , 52 , and the father of four boys , was shot to death at 10 p.m. as he stood chatting with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in Amherst , which is the largest Buffalo suburb .
Federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had concluded that James Kopp , an impassioned and nomadic opponent of abortion , fired the shots that killed a Buffalo , N.Y. , abortion-clinic doctor last October .
Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found in April month buried near the doctor 's house and a match between fibers found near the murder and others found in Kopp 's car _ officials said they had decided to issue a warrant for his arrest in the killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian .
Kopp , a fugitive , has until now been described only as a material witness and a nationwide warrant had been issued so that he could be held for questioning .
There was no official confirmation of the decision to upgrade the warrant , but Denise O'Donnell , the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York in Buffalo , has scheduled a news conference Thursday to announce a `` major development '' in the Slepian murder investigation .
Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark , Bernard Tolbert , the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office , and other investigators will also be there .
Since there is no federal homicide statute as such , the federal officials said Kopp could be charged under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act , which provides for a sentence of up to life imprisonment for someone convicted of physical assaults or threats against abortion providers .
If Kopp were also indicted and convicted on state murder charges , he could face the death penalty .
Slepian , a 52-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist who was the mainstay of Buffalo 's only abortion clinic , was shot to death on the night of Oct. 23 as he stood in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst , N.Y. chatting with his wife and one of his four sons .
No weapon was recovered in the first police searches of the area around Slepian 's home .
But on April 8 , investigators , wondering how the assailant could have emerged from the woods without fearing he would be seen carrying a rifle , searched the site of the shooting once more and unearthed a rifle buried one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home .
Clark , the Erie district attorney , said afterwards that investigators think the doctor 's killer buried the rifle in the days before the shooting , unearthed the weapon to fire the fatal shots , then hurriedly reburied it and fled .
The 44-year-old Kopp , who in FBI photographs appears as gaunt and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses were in Vermont and New Jersey , emerged as the focus of the investigation within two weeks of the slaying .
A jogger observed Kopp 's car at 6 a.m. near Slepian 's home 10 days before the murder , and , curious why a stranger would be parked there so early , wrote down the license plate number .
A six-year-old boy who arrived on US shores as a motherless refugee and became a political symbol for anti-Castro exiles must be returned to his father in Cuba , immigration authorities ruled Wednesday .
Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives in Miami , where the boy has been wooed with American toys and theme-park visits , or returning him to his apparently distraught father in Havana , the Immigration and Naturalization Service decided the boy should go home by Jan. 14 , INS commissioner Doris Meissner told reporters .
`` This little boy , who has been through so much , belongs with his father , '' Meissner told a news conference .
The decision was met with outrage by Cuban-Americans , who said the youngster will suffer under the repressive communist regime of Fidel Castro .
Lawyers for the boy 's family in Miami sent letters of protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton and said they were prepared to file a court appeal if Reno and Clinton spurn the Gonzalez family .
Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged the street near the local INS office in Miami Wednesday , demanding that Elian be allowed to stay .
`` Today is a sad day for the US Constitution . . . and for the hopes and dreams of Elian 's mother Elizabeth , '' who died with nine other adults when their boat sank as they attempted to reach Florida , said Roger Bernstein , representing the Miami Gonzalez family .
`` Nobody wants the boy to be separated from his father , '' said Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation .
`` But that little boy , by surviving two days on an inner tube , has earned the right to stay here in freedom . ''
In Havana , the government gave a guarded first response to the INS ruling , warning against `` excessive optimism '' and predicting `` the Cuban-American mafia and the extreme right in the U.S. Congress '' would still put up a fight to keep the boy .
Meissner said the INS decision was made after two lengthy interviews with the boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , a hotel worker in Cardenas , Cuba , who Meissner said is anxious to have Elian returned to him .
Since the boy is so young , Meissner said , the natural father has the right to speak for Elian .
There is `` no information '' that Gonzalez , who was divorced from Elian 's mother , is an unfit father , nor that he has been coerced by the Castro regime into pleading for his son 's return , Meissner said .
Spencer Eig , an attorney for the Gonzalez family in Miami , said Meissner 's assumptions were `` unconstitutional and untrue . ''
`` Elian cannot apply for asylum from persecution by the Fidel Castro government , '' Eig complained .
`` If only his father , who is under the control of the Fidel Castro regime , can do it for him . . . that is deeply unfair and untrue . ''
Meissner gave no reason for the Jan. 14 deadline , and it is still unclear how Elian would be transported back to Cuba if the Gonzalez family 's appeals are unsuccessful .
The INS offered three options : that Gonzalez come to pick up his son , that the family in Miami take him to Cuba , or that a `` third party '' escort the child to his homeland .
Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has indicated he does not want to travel to Miami , and there is `` no way '' the Miami Gonzalezes will assist in sending Elian back to Cuba , Perez said .
Having a third party escort Elian frees the INS from the politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do the task itself .
The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political force few politicians want to provoke .
Clinton has sought to distance himself from the controversy from the start .
`` I told you when we started this I would do my best to keep the decision out of politics , '' Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday .
But if Elian is forced to go back to Cuba , `` the Clinton-Gore administration , specifically ( Vice President ) Al Gore , will pay a high price in terms of votes in Florida , '' Perez said .
Cuba experts and child custody lawyers said the INS ruling was appropriate under the law .
`` It 's high time '' the boy was sent back to his birthplace , said Wayne Smith , a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba .
`` Every state court and every family court in the United States would award custody to a surviving parent rather than a distant relative who lives a more prosperous life , '' said David Abraham , a professor at Miami Law School and expert in custody law .
`` We may have the Disneylands and the Universal Studios and all the things that were dangled before the little boy 's eyes , '' Abraham added .
With the political implications so strong , it 's unlikely the case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed quickly , said Richard Nuccio , a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser .
`` With two members of Congress representing Elian 's family 's constituency , I do n't see how Elian could be returned by the federal government without it going through the court system , '' Nuccio said .
The New York Times says in an editorial on Thursday , Jan. 6 : & QL ;
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service made a reasonable decision Wednesday in ruling that Elian Gonzalez , the 6-year-old boy who survived an ill-fated migrant smuggling trip across the Florida Straits , should be reunited with his father back in Cuba .
The decision will inflame anti-Castro Cubans in Miami , but Doris Meissner , the INS commissioner , made it clear that the service had followed established policy in the case .
Moreover , by setting a Jan. 14 return date , the immigration service allowed Elian 's American relatives time to test the ruling in court .
Elian was one of 13 Cubans who were trying to cross from Cuba to Florida six weeks ago on a 17-foot aluminum powerboat when it capsized .
Ten of those on board died , including his mother and stepfather .
The boy clung to an inner tube for two days and was plucked from the Atlantic on Thanksgiving Day and brought ashore .
He was immediately released into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and just as quickly embraced as a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro 's regime and its opponents in exile .
This page has argued from the start that Elian not be denied due process because of his youth , and the INS appears to have moved carefully .
Elian 's great-uncle and other American relatives were allowed to make their case that he should have a life in Miami .
The boy 's divorced father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , was also interviewed and satisfied the agency that he had a close and involved relationship with his son .
The mother 's parents also argued for a return to Cuba .
The INS decided that under their prevailing policies , Gonzalez met the test that calls for custody reverting to the sole surviving parent in such cases .
`` This little boy , who has been through so much , belongs with his father , '' Meissner said Wednesday , adding that `` the unique relationship between parent and child and family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS practice . ''
The White House quickly announced support for the decision .
It is unclear how the political side of this affair will play out .
Elian 's relatives in Miami have indicated they plan to appeal , as is their right .
Some of their more militant supporters in Miami , decrying the prospect that the boy will be used as a `` trophy '' by Castro , have indicated they may try to disrupt efforts to reunite Elian with his father .
That would be treating the boy as a trophy in a diplomatic struggle that predates his birth by decades .
Good for Attorney General Janet Reno for the sensible opinion she rendered in the case of Elian Gonzalez .
Some semblance of constitutional order was necessary after a Miami judge turned legal logic on its head in an effort to route to her family court his Florida relatives ' appeal to keep the 6-year-old in the United States .
If the Immigration and Naturalization Service order that Elian must be returned to his father in Cuba is to be contested , Reno ruled correctly that the only proper venue is federal court , not state or local .
If and when the relatives ' appeal goes to federal court , chances of a favorable ruling are slim .
First of all , the INS already has taken the position the only person who can petition for U.S. asylum for Elian is his father , which he is not about to do .
Moreover , immigration law provides that asylum can only be granted where there is an imminent threat of torture or persecution in the petitioner 's homeland , which nobody expects in Elian 's case .
It 's not enough to argue Elian may suffer privation or oppression in Fidel Castro 's failed Communist state .
The INS routinely sends prospective immigrants back to countries where poverty and tyranny are worse than in Cuba .
What matters most is that Elian , after losing his mother and stepfather in a disastrous sea voyage to the United States last November , needs the love and care of surviving family members who 've known him all his life _ his father and both sets of grandparents in Cuba .
True , they ca n't give him all the material things his Miami benefactors can , but there are intangibles in close family bonds that are more valuable than bicycles and trips to Disney World .
The next order of business for the Justice Department and the INS is to resolve Elian 's case promptly .
They must n't countenance any delays by lawyers for his Miami relatives .
Besides , the longer his return is put off , the greater the chance of interference by calculating congressmen playing to the anti-Castro lobby .
Already one grandstanding Indiana Republican has subpoenaed Elian to testify before a House panel , and others in the Senate are preparing to vote the boy U.S. citizenship .
Both ploys are intended to thwart his reunion with his father .
The Justice Department and the INS must n't allow the opportunists of Capitol Hill to get their hooks into Elian .
The angry crowd rushed at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped out of Miami 's federal courthouse , shaking fists at him and shouting in Spanish , `` communista '' and `` traitor . ''
But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ducked his head and walked faster .
In a drama that has divided his once close-knit family and may finally be resolved in a court hearing the week of March 6 , Manuel Gonzalez , 59 , a soft-spoken bus mechanic , has remained largely out of the glare of television lights .
He was thrust into the middle of the swirling Gonzalez family saga when Elian 's father , Juan Miguel , sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno asking that his son be moved to Manuel Gonzalez 's home .
Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled Cuba for Miami , Manuel Gonzalez believes Elian should go back to Cuba to live with his father .
Reno denied the request , but Manuel Gonzalez did n't back down .
In a town where expressing even the slightest approval for Cuban President Fidel Castro can prompt threats of physical harm , Manuel Gonzalez filed a motion in federal court asking for custody of Elian so that he could help reunite the boy with his father in Cuba .
It was a move that many see as courageous and principled , but others fear may be foolhardy .
`` I have lost a son , '' Gonzalez told reporters later , referring to his own son 's death due to cancer .
`` I am supporting Juan Miguel because I know what it is to lose a son .
His sincerity did n't stop the talk on Little Havana 's streets or on Miami 's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations , which buzzed with callers lambasting Gonzalez for playing into the hands of a tyrant .
A day after he was hounded on the steps of the federal courthouse , Manuel Gonzalez would n't come to the door of his modest home in Miami 's Little Havana .
`` He must go to work , '' said his daughter , Rosa , who said Gonzalez would prefer not to talk about the issue .
After weeks of high-profile public sparring _ with charges of abuse , spying and treachery flying back and forth across the Florida Straits _ it would seem the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever heal the wounds created by the Elian saga .
But the family has overcome steep obstacles before .
Long before Elian thrust them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight , the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts and painful separations wrought by the Cuban revolution .
Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel 's generation , five have come to Miami , while three remain in Cuba and one has passed away .
According to press reports , Caridad Gonzalez , the oldest sister , was the first to come to the United States , arriving in 1966 .
Her brother Delfin , who was imprisoned as an anti-Castro activist in the 1960s , followed in 1979 .
Then came another sister , Georgina , in 1983 , followed by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984 .
Of those who stayed in Cuba , Juan Miguel 's father , Juan Gonzalez , seems the most closely allied with the Cuban government .
He worked as a police officer in a Cuban ministry , a position that probably helped his son _ Elian 's father _ get a job in the Communist island 's increasingly lucrative tourism industry .
The family 's experience is like that of thousands of others now split between Miami and Cuba , said Damien Fernandez , a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University .
`` Cubans value their families above almost anything , but the post-1959 politics have managed to split thousands of families apart , '' he said .
For decades , Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut off from the families they left behind .
Labeled `` worms '' and `` traitors '' by Castro , many were n't able to speak to _ much less visit _ their relatives for years .
The situation began to relax in the early 1990s , with the crisis triggered by the end of the former Soviet Union 's subsidies .
In desperate need of hard currency , Castro relaxed travel restrictions and allowed Cubans to have U.S. dollars , triggering a trickle of cash from Miami that soon became a flood .
By some estimates , the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and elsewhere in the United States _ send $1 billion a year in remittances back to their families on the island .
`` The Miami families have become a lifeline , and since 1990 there has been a great trend toward reconciliation , '' said Florida International 's Fernandez .
`` Although many families are still divided by politics , they have learned to forgive and forget and find common ground . ''
The branches of the family regularly talked by telephone and the Miami relatives went back to Cuba for several family reunions .
But Elian 's case has broken down the family 's fragile truce , with their political differences exacerbated by the inflammatory rhetoric flying between Castro 's government and exile extremists in Miami .
After making his opinions known , Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ostracized by his Miami kin , especially Lazaro , who has been keeping Elian and who has gone to court to try to keep the boy here .
The day before last Tuesday 's federal court hearing , Manuel went to Lazaro 's home to try to work out their differences .
Neither side would say what happened , but when Manuel returned to his house , he was so upset he felt heart palpitations and was taken to a hospital .
He was soon released and appeared to be reasonably healthy when he appeared in court the next morning .
But while Cuban exiles outside the courthouse cheered Lazaro and his family , their angry taunts seemed to shock Manuel .
His lawyer , however , insists he will continue to stand up for what he thinks is right .
`` He 's a strong man , '' said Jeffrey Leving .
`` He wo n't let anyone intimidate him from doing what is in Elian 's best interests . ''
To his credit , Lazaro Gonzalez has issued a statement asking Miami 's exiles to respect his brother 's opinions .
Manuel Gonzalez has told reporters that he believes his family will recover _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian 's case has brought .
`` The wounds of the problem will heal , '' he told the Los Angeles Times newspaper .
Elected officials in and around Miami warned U.S. immigration officials Wednesday that they should expect little help from the police here when they come for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez , and they said this city could erupt in violence if federal agents tried to forcibly take the boy from his great-uncle 's house in Little Havana and send him back to Cuba .
`` We will not lend our respective resources , whether they be in the form of police officers or any other resources , to assist the federal government in any way , shape or form to inappropriately repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba , '' said Alex Penelas , mayor of Miami-Dade County .
As of Wednesday evening , Lazaro Gonzalez , the boy 's great-uncle and temporary guardian , still had not signed an agreement to hand the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose a fight to keep him when the case is heard in May in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals .
`` I wo n't cooperate in anything , '' Gonzalez told a Spanish-language television station .
`` The boy lives in my house , and they 'll have to go find him there . ''
As pressure built in this city , the home of a large number of Cuban exiles , officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said they did not plan to remove Elian on Thursday morning even if his Miami relatives continued to defy them .
But an INS spokeswoman said the agency would revoke Elian 's permission to stay in the United States , clearing the way for his return to Cuba .
In Havana , Cuban President Fidel Castro said that the boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , would travel to the United States to bring his son home after the custody battle has been decided in the courts .
Elian 's father would be accompanied by other family members from Cuba , some of the boy 's former classmates and teachers , and psychiatric experts , Castro said on Cuban television .
`` We have the perfect formula for reinserting Elian , '' Castro said .
He also said that the group would be willing to wait as long as it takes to bring the boy back .
Asked to comment on Castro 's announcement , a Justice Department spokesman said :
`` Certainly it changes things .
How it changes things is a little hard to say at this point .
If the father shows up in Miami and decides to go and ring the doorbell of his relatives and find his son , well , the family in Miami is on record as saying they would turn over Elian to him .
Whether they actually do this remains to be seen . ''
Even miles away from sign-waving demonstrators who keep vigil outside the tiny house in Little Havana where Elian Gonzalez lives with his great-uncle , talk about the standoff between Elian 's Miami relatives and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials pours hot and quick from coffee stands on Calle Ocho and any other place Cuban Americans gather .
In rapid-fire Spanish , so fast that even people who learned the language in other Hispanic cultures can have trouble keeping up , they villify Attorney General Janet Reno , President Clinton and others who want to send the child back to his father in Cuba .
And they question _ or ridicule _ news that the boy 's father is planning to come here to retrieve his son .
It is a Communist plot hatched by the hated dictator , Fidel Castro , they say .
If you are not Cuban , they said , you just would not understand .
`` If it were n't Cuba , the child should go to be with his father , '' said Delfina Miranda , 49 , who works at a beauty salon in Little Havana .
That kid will get nothing in Cuba .
Over and over , Cuban Americans said that outsiders who did not suffer under the Castro regime simply could not understand their passions in the Elian standoff .
As talk on the streets swirled , talks between lawyers for Elian 's Miami relatives and government officials crept to an uneventful close .
U.S. Immigration officials postponed until Tuesday morning any action on revoking the boy 's temporary permission to stay in the United States , which would allow federal officials to , ultimately , take the boy from his relatives ' house and eventually return him to Cuba .
`` Like the family , we are monitoring developments concerning the possible arrival of ( Elian 's father ) Juan Miguel Gonzalez in the United States , '' said Robert Wallis , INS director for the Miami district .
Government officials had threatened to revoke the boy 's parole if his great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez , did not sign a document agreeing to hand Elian over to federal officials once the family 's appeal in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was decided .
But that standoff became less important in the eyes of Cuban Americans here after Castro announced Wednesday that the boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , is ready to travel to the United States to take his son home .
Gonzalez 's lawyer , Greg Craig , asked for a visa Thursday for his client for the expected visit , but was told by U.S. State Department officials that Gonzalez himself had to apply for the visa at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana .
`` Juan Miguel Gonzalez is ready at a moment 's notice to come to the United States , '' said Craig .
But in Miami , many Cuban Americans said Castro is orchestrating the visit .
Castro said Gonzalez would travel with his current wife and their son , a top government official , doctors , nurses , psychiatrists , Elian 's Cuban kindergarten teacher , classmates and his old school desk.A list of 31 people issued by the Cuban government Thursday included Ricardo Alarcon , president of Cuba 's National Assembly .
Castro has suggested that Elian and his relatives stay at the residence of Cuba 's chief diplomat in Washington .
Hidden in the entourage , cautioned Cuban Americans here , will be Cuban security agents who will make sure that Gonzalez _ and everyone else , for that matter _ does not defect .
`` They are coming with everyone , including psychologists , '' said Armando Sanjurjo , 73 .
`` You know why ?
To give Elian an injection and take him back to Cuba . ''
Sanjurjo , sipping a cafecito in front of Versailles restaurant , the nerve center for Cuban political discussions here in Little Havana , is convinced , like many others here , the entourage is designed to prevent any defections .
`` He 's coming with an entire court of people ?
What 's that about ? '' said Angela Esparragera , 71 .
Miranda said Elian 's father will be `` a virtual prisoner here if he comes with all those people .
He 'll be surrounded by people if he goes to the bathroom . ''
Gloria Estefan , the wildly popular singer of Cuban descent who has become an entertainment and cultural icon , was also suspicious of this visit .
`` If in fact , Elian 's father is permitted by the dictatorship of Fidel Castro to come to the United States , then , as a Cuban American , I welcome him and urge him to make all his decisions based on the well being and best interest of his son , and not that of the Cuban government , '' Estefan said .
All week , elected officials in Washington , D.C. , and at the state capital in Tallahassee have issued statement of support for Elian 's Miami relatives , even Vice President Al Gore , breaking from his own administration 's stand .
In Miami-Dade County , elected officials went as far as to say they their police departments would have no role in taking the boy from the house .
`` Send him back , '' said Marsha Raeber , 47 , an airline employee .
Some people are born rich , some people are born poor .
Who 's to say that he 's better off at Disney World and eating fast food here instead if breathing the fresh air of Cuba . ''
Eric Pichardo , 44 , is from Nicaragua , and said the Cuban-Americans `` need to follow the law .
Not all Cuban-Americans insist that Elian be allowed to stay .
Diana de Cardenas , 33 , was born in Cuba in 1984 .
`` I think he deserves to be with his father , '' she said .
`` It would be ideal if his father came , '' and then stayed , in Miami .
With a tense Miami waiting , federal immigration officials said Monday they will order the Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to turn the boy over to his father , who could come to the U.S. from Cuba as early as Tuesday .
`` Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father , '' said Maria Cardona , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service .
`` The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his father , but when and how . ''
Late Monday , U.S. State Department officials said that travel visas had been approved for Elian 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician , a psychologist and one of Elian 's favorite cousins .
The group might come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday , according to unconfirmed media reports .
But Miami 's volatile Cuban exiles continued to vow they would block any attempt to take Elian from the Little Havana home where he has been living with his Miami relatives , with some predicting bloodshed if federal agents come for the boy .
`` There will be thousands here to stop it if they come for him , '' said Ana Bonnin , one of about 100 exiles who practiced forming a human chain outside the home Monday .
`` We 'll try to do it peacefully , but you can only do so much .
You ca n't control everybody . ''
Late in the day , lawyers for Elian 's Miami family emerged from their third day-long meeting with federal officials , but said little .
`` We continue to be very concerned about the mental and psychological well-being of this 6-year-old , '' said Manny Diaz , one of the family 's attorneys .
`` To that end , we 'll be back tomorrow to continue our negotiations . ''
It was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would come to Miami to get Elian or if instead they would travel to Washington , D.C .
Cuban President Fidel Castro has said they would live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court case surrounding Elian 's fate is resolved .
Visas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers , classmates and others _ including Ricardo Alarcon , Cuban National Assembly president _ that Castro wants to accompany the family were not yet approved , officials said .
The rush of events caps a four-month ordeal that has seen Elian catapulted into the center an international tug-of-war .
He was found floating in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day after a boat carrying him from Cuba sank .
Federal officials placed him with his Miami relatives , but kept custody over him .
In January , Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled that Elian should go back to Cuba , a decision upheld by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno .
The Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the decision , but in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them .
They immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta .
Legal experts and federal officials maintain that Reno can allow the boy to be sent back to Cuba before the appeal is heard .
Last week , federal officials sought to have the family must sign an agreement to turn the boy over voluntarily should they lose their appeal .
If the family refused , INS had threatened to revoke Elian 's parole , meaning federal officials would take him from the Miami family .
The family refused to sign the agreement through two days of negotiations , and INS extended its deadline until 9 a.m. EST Tuesday .
The terms of the talks changed dramatically , however , when Castro announced last Wednesday that the boy 's father was ready to travel to the United States .
Previously , Gonzalez had said he would never come here to get his son .
Over the weekend , lawyers for the family raised accusations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had mistreated his son in telephone conversations , saying he had told the boy that his mother was alive and waiting for him in Cuba .
But by Monday , federal officials hardened their negotiating stance , insisting the boy would be turned over to his father once the Cuban group arrives in the United States .
Moves to keep Elian in this country through federal legislation appear to be stymied , as most lawmakers seem to agree the boy should go back to Cuba .
A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll shows that 6 of 10 Americans also believe the boy should go home with his father .
But in Miami , Cuban exiles insist the majority of Americans do n't understand the dynamics of life in Cuba .
Just how far they are willing to go to prove their point remains to be seen .
`` If he goes back , he wo n't be with his real father , '' said Elias Hernandez , who joined the crowd outside the Little Havana home of Elian 's Miami relatives .
The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday , April 6 :
Juan Miguel Gonzalez has made the right decision to travel to the United States on Thursday to affirm his desire to be reunited with his son , Elian .
His presence on American soil is necessary to dispel doubts about his fitness as a father _ raised maliciously by Elian 's Miami relatives _ and to end speculation that he is indifferent about reclaiming custody of his son .
With Gonzalez all but out of sight in Cuba , the relatives have had a free hand to distort the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated claims that Elian is afraid to see his father .
Once Gonzalez comes to the United States _ it would be preferable if he went to Miami rather than to Washington _ only the most obdurate foes of Castro can argue that Elian should not be reunited with him .
Gonzalez 's arrival should also help clear the way for the Justice Department to make arrangements to transfer custody of the child .
The Miami relatives have left unclear whether they will willingly relinquish custody of Elian , and have done their best to stir passions against the Justice Department among Cuban-Americans in South Florida .
In hopes of trumping the law , they have unreasonably demanded that a panel of child psychologists determine Elian 's fate .
The best outcome would be for the relatives to turn Elian over to his father as soon as Gonzalez arrives , and to do so in a spirit of kinship that makes the transition as smooth as possible for Elian .
Once that happens , Gonzalez and Elian , though technically free to return to Cuba , should remain here to await an appellate court ruling on the case , which is expected next month .
But if the relatives balk , the Justice Department should quickly revoke their custody of the child and obtain a federal court order instructing them and their lawyers to turn Elian over to his father .
The relatives may be less defiant if they are held in contempt of court .
If a court edict fails to compel compliance , the Justice Department will have to consider sterner measures , for the relatives will then be resisting the rule of law as defined by both the department and the courts .
But Washington ought not to rush to take Elian forcibly from the relatives .
That course would be psychologically wounding to the boy , and could lead to a violent confrontation with demonstrators who gather daily outside the relatives ' home .
The government yields none of its legal or moral authority in the case if it gives the relatives and their supporters time to reflect and to look for a gentler resolution .
As a matter of law , compassion and common sense , the government is entitled to reunite Elian with his father , and it has the power to enforce that right , despite the bluster of Miami 's demagogic political leaders .
But for now , everyone involved should be searching for an amicable ending .
Juan Gonzalez is doing his part by making the short journey across the Florida Straits to erase any question about his love for his son .
No Cuban flags sway from its door and no political signs pushing for the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its windows .
And while she maintains a distance between herself and the heated rhetoric and politics that envelop Miami , Friday she had definite opinions on the case of the 6-year-old Cuban boy that has dominated the city for almost five months now .
`` I feel for this child , '' Juanita Castro said .
`` This has become too politicized , in both Cuba and Miami , and too many people are profiting from this tragedy .
I think people have forgotten that this is a human issue . ''
Juanita Castro , who arrived in Miami in 1961 , believes the custody of the child should be worked out between his family members .
She is not certain whether the boy should stay in the United States , but she feels that since he 's been here so long , he should be afforded the opportunity to live in a free country .
When asked if she thought the boy 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , was being controlled by the Cuban government even though he has been in Bethesda , Md. , for the last week , she frowned .
`` I do n't know what Juan Miguel thinks or believes , '' Juanita Castro said .
`` What I do think is that he should have arrived in this country at least 72 hours after his son was found floating off the coast of Fort Lauderdale . ''
`` This has gone too far .
And it 's now become a tragedy . ''
Dressed in a dark pink blazer and cream color pants , the sister of the Cuban dictator walked around the pharmacy talking warmly with her customers .
She said she she sometimes talks to family members back in Cuba .
`` I have sisters that I still speak to , '' she said , `` and this situation is driving people crazy . ''
The only thing on Cuban television is Elian 's story , she said , and she feels the Cuban people are getting tired of the issue .
She does not speak to her brother and has n't for several years .
`` Nobody talks to Fidel , because he does n't listen , '' Juanita Castro said .
`` He talks and he decides . ''
Juanita Castro said she has not visited the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and has no plans to do so .
Although she supports the cause of Miami 's Cubans in their struggle against her brother 's government , she said she prefers to keep a low profile when it comes to politics .
`` I just work in my pharmacy every day and I pray for a resolution in our country ( Cuba ) that is without violence , '' she said .
`` And I also pray for this young boy every day because he needs help .
The Clinton administration 's wisdom in returning Elian Gonzalez to his father was confirmed over the weekend decision of his Miami relatives and their Republican allies to further politicize what ought to be a straightforward child-custody case .
Elian is finally getting time to reconnect with his father in a quiet , neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for the war between the Cubans .
A few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base , Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire , Representative Tom DeLay of Texas , both Republicans , and the relatives were treating the raid to return Elian as though it were a Nazi SS operation .
Yet federal agents had a warrant , were enforcing US law , and entered the house with the proper force to ensure minimal resistance and injury .
The raid was necessary because the Gonzalez relatives in Miami , refusing to return the boy , made him into a symbol of resistance to Fidel Castro .
Elian printed his name on an application for asylum and was put in front of a video camera to say that he did not want to go back to Cuba .
The relatives treated the boy like a political prop .
Had the relatives allowed Elian to return to Cuba , they would have denied the dictator an opportunity to reenergize support for his regime .
Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter , but that should not disqualify him from being reunited with his child .
Ever since he first learned that Elian was in Florida last November , he has been persistent in seeking the boy 's return .
Elian has developed great affection for the Miami relatives .
It would be ideal if they could have returned him to his father yet stayed in contact while their appeal was pending in court .
Negotiations failed , however , because they insisted on taking the place of the father , rather than being treated as concerned , yet distant , relatives .
The father can remain here , but he can also return to Cuba if he wishes .
Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a loving parent , Elian should go wherever that parent wants .
Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States for at least two more weeks even after a federal appeals court Thursday refused to order a political asylum hearing for the fought-over Cuban child .
Elian could be forced to stay longer if the Miami relatives who are seeking asylum for the child over his Cuban father 's objections pursue further appeals .
Attorney Kendall Coffey said his clients were giving an appeal to the Supreme Court `` serious consideration . ''
The Miami relatives could also request a rehearing before the same three-judge panel that issued Thursday 's ruling , or before the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal .
But Thursday 's decision made it clear the family has only 14 days to decide whether to request a rehearing at that level. & UR ;
& LR ; `` Expect no extensions , '' the court instructed .
The ruling follows six months of international family infighting , political recriminations and wide-spread protests in both Miami and Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy .
His mother died trying to smuggle Elian out of Cuba , and it has been difficult for family members , Miami community leaders and many politicians to separate attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro from the legal issues involved .
The appellate ruling made it clear the court takes no joy in lifting an obstacle to Elian 's return to Cuba .
`` We acknowledge , as a widely accepted truth , that Cuba does violate human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not guarantee the rule of law to people living in Cuba , '' wrote Judge J.L. Edmonson , on behalf of the panel .
But the Immigration and Naturalization Service 's decision to deny Elian an asylum hearing was `` within the outside border of reasonable choices , '' the opinion read .
`` The court neither approves nor disapproves the INS' decision to reject the asylum applications filed on plaintiff 's behalf , but the INS decision did not contradict ( federal law . ) ''
The judges denied , however , a request by Elian 's father to name him instead of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as Elian 's representative in the continued court proceedings .
Making Juan Miguel Gonzalez his son 's legal representative would have allowed him to simply drop the asylum request and head for home .
Elian 's great-uncle vowed to continue the battle , and said the Miami relatives might sue for visitation while the child is in the United States .
`` We will keep fighting with the laws ... so Elian Gonzalez can live in a free country like his mother wanted , '' Lazaro Gonzalez said .
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno praised the ruling , with both stressing their confidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the best person to raise his child. & UR ;
& LR ; `` As I 've said before , this is a case about the importance of family and the bond between a father and son , '' Clinton said in a written statement issued from Berlin .
Elian 's father asked his Miami relatives to end their court battle after Thursday 's ruling and allow him to finally return home with his son .
`` A child should simply be with his parents , always his parents , '' the elder Gonzalez said through an interpreter .
Switching to English , he said , `` I want to thank the American people .
Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida by two American fishermen last November after the boat he was in capsized .
Elian 's mother and 10 others died , but the boy survived by clinging to an inner tube .
Elian 's Miami relatives took in the child , but then refused to return him to his surviving father in Cuba , citing the harshness of the Castro regime .
The Miami relatives applied for political asylum on Elian 's behalf , saying the child did not want to return to Cuba .
INS agents traveled to Cuba to interview the child 's father before the INS rejected the application for asylum , saying the child 's father was the only person authorized to represent him .
A district court judge upheld the federal agency .
The Miami relatives appealed that decision , and obtained an injunction requiring Elian to remain in the United States until the asylum question worked its way through the courts .
Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived in the United States April 2 , and Reno ordered the Miami relatives to surrender the child to his father .
The family refused , and federal agents took the child by force in a pre-dawn raid on the Miami relatives ' home on April 22 .
The father and his son lived for a month on a large , private estate in Maryland , but have recently moved to an affluent neighborhood in Washington , D.C. , to wait out the rest of their time in the United States .
Shortly after the appellate panel released its decision , attorney Coffey filed an emergency request to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ( who has jurisdiction over such matters from Florida ) requesting assurance that Elian will remain in the United States until the full Supreme Court can consider a formal appeal .
But Reno said the request to Kennedy serves no purpose since the injunction blocking Elian 's return to Cuba still applies .
If the family fails to file an appeal within 14 days , she said , the soonest Elian would be free to leave the country would be seven days later .
However , Justice Department officials said the appellate court could decide to waive the extra seven-day period .
Protesters were beginning to gather outside the Miami relatives ' home even before the ruling was issued .
They yelled and wept when the decision was announced .
In a statement read on Cuban television , Castro 's government expressed its displeasure at still another delay in Elian 's return .
The government called the 14-day waiting period `` another concession to the ` mafia' _ a disparaging term the government frequently uses to describe Miami 's exile Cuban community .
Jose Basulto , founder of Brothers to the Rescue , a Cuban exile group that frequently rescues Cuban refugees from the Straits of Florida , called the latest ruling `` outrageous . ''
`` The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a turning point in relations in the Cuban community and the United States , '' Basulto said .
`` This day , in the history of their relations with the United States , will be remembered in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of Pigs is remembered . ''
Cuban exiles failed to overthrow Castro in 1961 when the communist leader repelled their invasion at the Bay of Pigs .
South Africa deplored Friday the bomb blasts which killed scores of people and injured more than 1,000 others outside embassies of the United States in Kenya and Tanzania earlier in the day .
A statement by the Foreign Affairs Department described the attacks as senseless .
" The South African government deplores these senseless acts against the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and would like to express its condolences to the victims of the explosions , " the statement said .
Reports reaching here said a massive blast damaged the U.S. embassy in Nairobi , killing 40 people while wounding at least 1,000 people .
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho and American ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell were injured in the blast .
Also on Friday morning , at least four people were killed in an explosion that took place near the American embassy in Dar es Salaam , the capital of Tanzania .
As far as could be established , no South Africans had been affected by the blasts , the South African Foreign Affairs Department said .
The flu season is winding down , and it has killed 105 children so far - about the average toll .
The season started about a month earlier than usual , sparking concerns it might turn into the worst in a decade .
It ended up being very hard on the elderly , but was moderately severe overall , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Six of the pediatric deaths were reported in the last week , and it 's possible there will be more , said the CDC 's Dr. Michael Jhung said Friday .
Roughly 100 children die in an average flu season .
One exception was the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010 , when 348 children died .
The CDC recommends that all children ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu each season , though only about half get a flu shot or nasal spray .
All but four of the children who died were old enough to be vaccinated , but 90 percent of them did not get vaccinated , CDC officials said .
This year 's vaccine was considered effective in children , though it did n't work very well in older people .
In that group , 177 out of every 100,000 were hospitalized with flu-related illness in the past several months .
This flu season started in early December , a month earlier than usual , and peaked by the end of year .
Since then , flu reports have been dropping off throughout the country .
" We appear to be getting close to the end of flu season , " Jhung said .
Barack Obama would make a great stand-up comic , not because he 's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do : as a weapon .
Traditionally , the ( intentionally ) funny lines by our presidents have had one thing in common : They were self-deprecating .
Sure , some presidents have used jokes to take jabs at their opponents , but not to the extent of Obama .
During his tenure , he has increasingly unleashed biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries .
These jokes are intended to do more than simply entertain you .
He tries to undermine his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side .
I can assure you that having a crowd laugh at your critic / heckler is not only effective in dominating them , it 's also very satisfying .
A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday , Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced .
Raymond Roth , 48 , of Massapequa , New York , was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son , Jonathan Roth .
Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies , New York State Park Police said , authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina , where he had been pulled over for speeding .
The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over , his wife , Evana , showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death .
Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida , Rice said .
State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud , conspiracy and filing a false report .
Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years ' probation , the district attorney 's office said .
He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department .
Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July .
Her attorney , Lenard Leeds , said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence .
" There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going .
Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort , " Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing .
The son 's case is still pending , the district attorney said .
Jonathan Roth 's attorney , Joey Jackson , defended his client after his arrest , saying , " There was abuse here , manipulation here , coercion here " from the father .
Raymond Roth 's attorney , Brian Davis , denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme .
" We had issues concerning the facts people had whether ( Roth ) had an agreement with his son , " Davis told CNN on Thursday .
" He 's admitted it now .
He 's accepted responsibility . "
Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks .
During plea negotiations , Raymond Roth asked the district attorney 's office not to give his son jail time , Davis said .
On the advice of both their attorneys , father and son have not been in contact since their arrests , Davis said .
" He would like to straighten things out with ( Jonathan ) when the time comes , " he said .
Before the arrival of Keep , which Google launched this week , there was no default note-taking app for Android .
It was a glaring hole , considering that Apple 's iPhone has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be powered by Siri .
Instead of settling for a bare bones app to fill the void , the search giant took things one step further .
That said , it 's not going to conquer the world quite yet .
Like most things Google , expect the company to flesh out Keep over time and really turn it into our personal internet junk drawer .
It 's easy to foresee the day the when users will be able to send anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep .
The prospect of Keep incorporating features of services such as Pinterest or Pocket , or even making it easy to catalog streaming media , could turn it into something big .
That should scare Evernote .
In filling a minor , but important gap in its mobile ecosystem , Google gives the competition one less claim of superiority over Android .
The FAA on Friday announced it will close 149 regional airport control towers because of forced spending cuts -- sparing 40 others that the FAA had been expected to shutter .
A four-week , phased closure of the 149 control towers will begin on April 7 , the FAA said .
The FAA had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low - or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors .
Before Friday 's announcement , it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the " national interest " to do so .
By congressional mandate , the FAA must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget this fiscal year .
Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers , it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers , the agency says .
President Barack Obama arrived in refugee-flooded Jordan on Friday after scoring a diplomatic coup just before leaving Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla .
The apology , long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan , eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel , two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East .
It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president 's Middle East swing .
A statement from Netanyahu 's office said the apology included an offer of compensation .
However , there was confusion later when the Israeli government dropped a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a return of ambassadors .
There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the flotilla raid .
Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops .
Later , however , its amended statement omitted that action as well .
Microsoft Corp. broke sales records in 2010 when it released its Kinect - a movement-tracking device that enabled Xbox users to play their favorite games through gestures alone , without need of a controller .
Now , with the help of outside developers , the software giant is hoping to move the Kinect beyond gaming .
Microsoft is expanding into China with a company-funded incubator program for outside developers to build products based on Kinect technology for a range of industries including health care and retail .
In the U.S. , 11 companies were selected last year for the accelerator 's first three-month class in Seattle , out of nearly 500 applicants .
Microsoft said it has identified three companies for the China program to run through June .
The company gives each participating startup in the Seattle program $20,000 to create software that can be used with Kinect for Windows , but it is is n't asking for any ownership stakes or intellectual property rights .
Microsoft also does n't have any veto power over the ideas .
What Microsoft gets are developers around the world working on ideas that could potentially open up Kinect for Windows ' technology to new markets - and convince consumers and businesses to buy the company 's hardware and make use of the potential apps .
The Windows-ready Kinect sensor , which would be necessary for any business that wants to use these potential new technologies , is currently selling for $250 through Microsoft , more than twice what Microsoft charges for the gaming-only Xbox version .
But Iram Leon stands on the sidelines of his own race against time .
Lodged in his brain is an untreatable and inoperable cancerous tumor that statistics suggest will kill him before he is 40 , eight years from now .
Medical science is advancing at a rate that does n't preclude the development of a treatment , but it 's not clear if it will come in time .
" No one knows what technology will be available in five years , " said Allan Friedman , Duke University Hospital neurosurgeon in chief , who in 2011 removed as much of Leon 's brain tumor as possible .
Some seek escape in their careers , but that is no longer an option for Leon , who early this year was forced to step down as a juvenile probation officer in Travis County , Texas , a position he had held for almost seven years .
His thinking is no longer clear , said Leon , adding , " I was making too many mistakes on the stand . "
What has startled the medical community even more is what Leon did this month in Beaumont , Texas .
He won the Gusher Marathon , finishing in 3:07:35 .
That was one second slower than his personal record in the 26.2-mile event , set days before he underwent brain surgery in early 2011 .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized on Friday to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a raid on a Turkish flotilla ship , a move that will help restore strained ties between the countries .
The call , which happened as President Barack Obama wrapped up his first presidential visit to Israel , was an unexpected outcome from a Mideast trip that seemed to yield few concrete steps .
Mr. Netanyahu 's office confirmed that the Israeli leader , in a conversation with Mr. Erdogan , " agreed to restore normalization between Israel and Turkey , including the dispatch of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal steps against [ Israeli Defense Forces ] soldiers . "
Mr. Erdogan accepted the Israeli apology , the prime minister 's office said .
Mr. Erdogan has long sought an apology for the raid in May 2010 on the Mavi Marmara , which was part of a flotilla that sought to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
An Israeli raid on the ship left nine passengers dead , all of them Turkish or of Turkish descent .
" In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident , which pointed out several operational errors , Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation , " the statement said .
Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Erdogan that what happened on board the Mavi Marmara was " unintentional and Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life , " according to the statement .
Mr. Obama said later at a news conference in Amman that he had spoken to both leaders over the past two years about how it was in the interests of both countries to restore normal relations .
He said he discussed the issue with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel this week , and that they agreed the timing was good for a discussion with the Turkish leader .
The incident was a subject of talks between Mr. Netanyahu and President Barack Obama during the president 's trip to Israel this week , officials said .
Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could increase sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul law , with the nation 's biggest firm projecting that rates could more than double for some consumers buying their own plans .
The projections , made in sessions with brokers and agents , provide some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might increase prices when major provisions of the law kick in next year - a subject of rigorous debate .
The projected increases are at odds with what the Obama Administration says consumers should be expecting overall in terms of cost .
The Department of Health and Human Services says that the law will " make health-care coverage more affordable and accessible , " pointing to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums , on an apples-to-apples basis , would be lower .
The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections suggests how complicated the law 's effects will be .
Carriers will be filing proposed prices with regulators over the next few months .
Part of the murkiness stems from the role of government subsidies .
Federal subsidies under the health law will help lower-income consumers defray costs , but they are generally not included in insurers ' premium projections .
Many consumers will be getting more generous plans because of new requirements in the law .
The effects of the law will vary widely , and insurers and other analysts agree that some consumers and small businesses will likely see premiums go down .
Starting next year , the law will block insurers from refusing to sell coverage or setting premiums based on people 's health histories , and will reduce their ability to set rates based on age .
That can raise coverage prices for younger , healthier consumers , while reining them in for older , sicker ones .
The rules can also affect small businesses , which sometimes pay premiums tied to employees ' health status and claims history .
The last surviving member of the team which first conquered Everest in 1953 has died in a Derbyshire nursing home .
George Lowe , 89 , died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness , with his wife Mary by his side .
New Zealand-born Mr Lowe was part of the team that helped Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953 .
Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a " gentle soul and fine climber " who shunned the limelight .
Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58 , which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole .
He later made expeditions to Greenland , Greece and Ethiopia .
Speaking to the BBC in 1995 , Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure : " We estimated we could do it in 100 days , and we got across on the 99th day .
It had a multiplying effect .
" We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it , and we thought that 's where it would stop . "
He also talked about his " second job " as the group 's cameraman , and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera .
Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it ? " he said .
Dr Lewis-Jones , the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge , who first met Mr Lowe in 2005 , called him a " hero " .
" I do n't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one , " he said .
A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe , which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones , is due to be published in May .
He said : " Lowe was a brilliant , kind fellow who never sought the limelight ... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition .
" He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century ... yet remained a humble , happy man right to the end ... an inspirational lesson to us all . "
Before retiring in 1984 , Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences , and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage .
The last British climbing member of the 1953 team , Mike Westmacott , died last June .
Israel 's prime minister has apologised to Turkey for " any errors that could have led to loss of life " during the 2010 commando raid on an aid flotilla that tried to breach the Gaza blockade .
Benjamin Netanyahu also agreed with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to compensate the families of the nine activists who were killed .
Mr Netanyahu had previously only expressed regret for the deaths .
The deal was brokered by US President Barack Obama during a visit to Israel .
Mr Erdogan 's office said he had accepted the apology , " in the name of the Turkish people " .
In the past , he has always given two conditions for restoring bilateral relations with Israel - an apology and compensation for victims ' families .
Nine people were killed on board the Turkish aid ship , Mavi Marmara , when it was boarded by Israeli commandos while trying to transport aid supplies to Gaza in May 2010 in spite of an Israeli naval blockade .
The Israeli government admitted mistakes were made in intelligence-gathering and planning , but insisted its commandos used lethal force because activists had attacked them .
The activists said the troops had opened fire as soon as they boarded the vessel , which was in international waters at the time .
The incident provoked an international outcry and led to a major deterioration in relations between Turkey and Israel .
Before departing for Jordan on Friday afternoon , Mr Obama revealed that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Erdogan had just spoken by telephone .
Heavy snow is causing disruption to transport across the UK , with heavy rainfall bringing flooding to the south-west of England .
Rescuers searching for a woman trapped in a landslide at her home in Looe , Cornwall , said they had found a body .
Over 200,000 Belfast customers were affected by a blackout but power is starting to be restored .
Northern Ireland 's World Cup qualifier with Russia has been postponed until 15:00 GMT Saturday due to heavy snow .
There are 12 flood warnings in the South West , with Met Office warnings for snow covering much of the UK .
This comes just over a week before the start of British Summer Time .
BBC forecasters said the snow would cause travel disruption across northern parts of the UK on Friday , with some 20cm-40cm ( 8in-16in ) falling in places .
Atrocious conditions could be expected on high ground , they said .
Roads in northern parts of Wales , the Midlands into the Pennines , southern Scotland and Northern Ireland would be the worst affected , while gale force winds would blow snow and drifts across trans-Pennine routes , they added .
Oil giant BP has said it will buy back $8bn of shares , returning to shareholders the money they had put into a complicated Russian venture .
It said it " expected to return to BP shareholders an amount equivalent to the value of the company 's original investment in TNK-BP " .
BP agreed to sell back its 50 % stake in TNK-BP to Russia 's Rosneft in October in return for $17.1bn in cash and shares .
It invested in TNK-BP in 2003 .
BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said : " We expect our stake in Rosneft will generate long-term value for BP and its shareholders .
But this buyback programme should also allow our shareholders to see benefits in the near-term from the value we have realised by reshaping our Russian business . "
BP expects the share buyback programme could take between 12 and 18 months to complete .
" In 2003 BP invested around $8bn in cash , shares and assets in the formation of TNK-BP , " the oil giant said .
" Over the following decade BP received a total of $19bn in dividends from the joint venture . "
In 2011 , the AAR consortium attempted to block a drilling joint venture in the Arctic between BP and Rosneft through the courts and the plan was eventually dropped .
As well as internal wrangles , BP employees at TNK-BP have fallen foul of Russian authorities .
While serving as head of TNK-BP , Bob Dudley - now the head of BP as a whole - had his office bugged and raided by the police and met with onerous back-tax demands , legal action and visa problems .
He eventually fled the country in 2008 .
But the tie-up with Rosneft will keep BP in Russia , allowing it to continue to explore and exploit the country 's vast energy resources , including in the Arctic region .
Russian police and tax inspectors have raided the offices of the human rights group Memorial and other civil society groups which get foreign funding .
Memorial is famous for documenting human rights abuses in Russia .
The US embassy in Moscow has voiced concern and asked the Russian government for an explanation .
A new Russian law says foreign-funded non-governmental groups ( NGOs ) linked to politics must register as " foreign agents " - a term which suggests spying .
In the worst repressions of the Soviet period the label " foreign agents " was used to denounce dissidents - or simply political rivals of Joseph Stalin - and could lead to execution .
Memorial says inspectors returned to its Moscow offices on Friday , having already seized 600 documents including accounts on Thursday .
A statement on the Memorial website said the inspections were directly linked to the new law on NGOs and the targeted groups ' compliance with it .
Memorial director Arseny Roginsky , quoted by the Russian news website Vesti , said it was " a complete check on everything concerned with our sources of funding " .
He insisted that the NGO law " will not change our position at all " .
" We wo n't refuse foreign donations , nor will we register as a 'foreign agent' , " he said .
China 's state leadership transition has taken place this month against an ominous backdrop .
More than 16,000 dead pigs have been found floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai .
A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital , causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City .
So severe are China 's environmental woes , especially the noxious air , that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them .
Fu Ying , the spokeswoman for the National People 's Congress , said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself .
Li Keqiang , the new prime minister , said the air pollution had made him " quite upset " and vowed to " show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts " to clean it up .
Last month , after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China , officials led byWen Jiabao , then the prime minister , put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years .
But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply , especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago .
The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants , according to ministry data .
And as with the oil companies , the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates .
In 2011 , during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards , the China Electricity Council , which represents the companies , pushed back hard against the proposals , saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high .
On Feb. 28 , Deutsche Bank released an analysts ' note saying that China 's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade .
" China 's air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level , " the analysts said , calling for drastic policy changes and " a strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups . "
The report estimated that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to hit 400 million by 2030 , up from 90 million now .
A Cyprus exit from the euro union , if it comes to that , would have a devastating effect on the country 's citizens , who are among the most indebted in the euro zone .
ut for the broader financial system in Europe , the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country 's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out .
And that , economists and investors contend , is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse , Jeroen Dijsselbloem , the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers , were so adamant that depositors - large and small , Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ( $ 7.5 billion ) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus 's largest banks .
Greece may well have been too big to fail last year , but Cyprus , which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone 's gross domestic product , is certainly not .
Only Ireland , still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010 , has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries .
As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens , companies and governments to make good on them , the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run .
" There have been too many bailouts in Europe ; it 's time to remove the air bags , " said Stephen Jen , a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London .
" This is not a Lehman , " he said , referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 .
Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union .
Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros , given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country .
" This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus , " said Mr. Dor , head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille , France .
" They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone , and that Europe can take the losses without going broke . "
Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse .
Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments .
So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped .
" It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee , " Mr. Dor said .
A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent , once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds , the currency Cyprus used before adopting the euro in 2007 .
Former President Nicolas Sarkozy was informed Thursday that he would face a formal investigation into whether he abused the frailty of Liliane Bettencourt , 90 , the heiress to the L'Oreal fortune and France 's richest woman , to get funds for his 2007 presidential campaign .
Mr. Sarkozy has denied accepting illegal campaign funds from Ms. Bettencourt , either personally or through his party treasurer at the time , Eric Woerth , as alleged by her former butler .
Mr. Sarkozy 's lawyer , Thierry Herzog , called the judge 's decision , which indicates that the judge believes that Mr. Sarkozy probably committed a crime , " incoherent " and " unjust . "
The lawyer said he would appeal .
The ruling does not necessarily mean that Mr. Sarkozy , who lost his re-election bid last May and with it his presidential immunity from prosecution , will stand trial .
An hour before her colleagues gathered for their first vote of a new Congress , Senator Kelly Ayotte slipped into an empty Senate chamber to savor the grandeur of her legislative home .
As Ms. Ayotte , a freshman Republican from New Hampshire , sat down at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had cast their votes , a doorman marched toward her with purpose .
The desks , he sternly told her , were for senators only .
Ms. Ayotte 's induction that January day in 2011 into the most rarefied ranks of the nation 's political class , female senators , had begun .
" The desk thing really stuck with me , " Ms. Ayotte said .
In the 90 years since Rebecca Felton of Georgia became the first woman in the United States Senate - sworn in for a mere 24 hours - women remain an anomaly in the upper chamber .
But with 20 female senators now in office , an all-time high , women have morphed from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th century into an important new force on key committees and legislation .
For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski , a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee , which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly dominated by men .
Senator Patty Murray , a Washington Democrat , is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is charged with shaping the Democratic strategy in the fiscal battle dominating Capitol Hill .
One of the biggest bills to pass the Senate last year was farm legislation led by Senator Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat who presides over the agriculture committee .
Senator Barbara Boxer , the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , shepherded the highway bill .
" We are growing in number , " said Senator Amy Klobuchar , Democrat of Minnesota .
" But more importantly , we are growing in our power .
When I first started just six years ago , it was unusual to have a woman managing a bill . "
Just as important , even male senators say , is the potential the women hold for changing the tenor of the Senate and pushing for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill .
" I do n't want to generalize , because this is n't true of all of them , but they tend to be interested in finding common ground , " said Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio .
" So I think it 's going to have , and is having , a positive impact on the Senate . "
While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress , women have begun to crack away at the gridlock by forming coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties .
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand , Democrat of New York , and Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , led the repeal in the Senate of " do n't ask , do n't tell " in 2010 , allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military .
This year , all four of the female Senate Republicans split with their party and voted with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act , which had lapsed during the last Congress .
But a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially deployed by a major American military contractor is taking computing into the strange , subatomic realm of quantum mechanics .
But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft , I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been working to develop quantum computers .
Now , Lockheed Martin which bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems two years ago is confident enough in the technology to upgrade it to commercial scale , becoming the first company to use quantum computing as part of its business .
Skeptics say that D-Wave has yet to prove to outside scientists that it has solved the myriad challenges involved in quantum computation .
But if it performs as Lockheed and D-Wave expect , the design could be used to supercharge even the most powerful systems , solving some science and business problems millions of times faster than can be done today .
Ray Johnson , Lockheeds chief technical officer , said his company would use the quantum computer to create and test complex radar , space and aircraft systems .
It could be possible , for example , to tell instantly how the millions of lines of software running a network of satellites would react to a solar burst or a pulse from a nuclear explosion something that can now take weeks , if ever , to determine .
Margalit Har-Shefi , 22 , has pleaded innocent to charges that she failed to report Yigal Amir 's plan to kill Rabin .

JERUSALEM ( AP ) _ Taking the stand in her own defense , a friend of Yitzhak Rabin 's assassin said Friday that she regretted calling the prime minister a traitor and praying for his death .
Margalit Har-Shefi , 22 , has pleaded innocent to charges that she failed to report Yigal Amir 's plan to kill Rabin .
She took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate 's court .
Amir , 27 , is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally .
Newspaper reports have said Amir was infatuated with Har-Shefi and may have been trying to impress her by killing the prime minister .
Har-Shefi acknowledged she told police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor and that she prayed for him to have a heart attack and die .
She said Rabin 's murder was `` a black stain on Israel , '' Israel radio and Israel army radio reported .
Har-Shefi said she heard Amir talk about killing Rabin but did not tell the police because she did not believe he was serious .
Instead , she turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told him about Amir 's statements .
The rabbi said called the talk about killing Rabin `` nonsense , '' and said Jews are prohibited from killing one another , the radio reports said .
Har-Shefi described Amir as an `` original thinker , '' as well as delusional and a liar .
She also denied accusations made by Amir 's brother , Hagai , that she joined an anti-Arab underground movement .
She said she gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked her to help organize such a movement .

Any decision to expel Sinn Fein must be agreed jointly by the governments of both Britain and the Irish Republic .

BUDAPEST , Hungary ( AP ) _ Tired of being sidelined , Hungarian astronaut Bertalan Farkas is leaving for the United States to start a new career , he said Saturday .
`` Being 48 is too early to be retired , '' a fit-looking Farkas said on state TV 's morning talk show .
With American astronaut Jon McBride , Farkas set up an American-Hungarian joint venture called Orion 1980 , manufacturing space-travel related technology .
Farkas will move to the company 's U.S. headquarters .
Farkas , an air force captain , was sent into space on board the Soyuz 36 on May 26 , 1980 .
He spent six days aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts , Valery Kubasov , Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin .
McBride , 54 , of Lewisburg , West Virginia , was part of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in October 1984 and later served as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA .
Farkas expressed the hope he one day follow in the footsteps of fellow astronaut John Glenn , who at 77 is about to go into space again .
On May 22 , 1995 , Farkas was made a brigadier general , and the following year he was appointed military attache at the Hungarian embassy in Washington .
However , cited by District of Columbia traffic police in December for driving under the influence of alcohol , Farkas was ordered home and retired .
ISTANBUL , Turkey ( AP ) _ Some 1,500 ethnic Albanians marched Sunday in downtown Istanbul , burning Serbian flags to protest the killings of ethnic Albanians by Serb police in southern Serb Kosovo province .
The police barred the crowd from reaching the Yugoslavian consulate in downtown Istanbul , but allowed them to demonstrate on nearby streets .
`` Stop the bloodshed in Kosovo , '' the protesters chanted .
Meanwhile in the capital , Ankara , a few hundred ethnic Albanians laid a black wreath at the gate of Yugoslavian embassy .
Serbian police say they are trying to eliminate the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army and restore order .
At least 51 people were reported killed in clashes between Serb police and ethnic Albanians in the troubled region in recent days .
Turkey , worried about civil war in Kosovo spilling to the whole Balkans , urged all Balkan states to sign a joint declaration that the Kosovo crisis be solved peacefully and without any change of borders .
MOSCOW ( AP ) _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan Friday , and Yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems .
Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages , and Ukraine was ruled from Moscow for centuries .
But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners , their relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ Black Sea naval bases , border problems and Ukraine 's natural gas debts .
`` We have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them , '' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency .
`` I must say there are no unsettled problems any more .
We have solved them all . ''
But his sweeping statement contained no details , and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved .
Their solution would require a compromise between the two nations ' parliaments .
A major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation , which the two presidents signed last May .
In effect , the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine 's sovereignty and borders , and the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified it .
However , Russia has stalled ratification , trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the Russian navy to use a naval base on Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years .
In their joint statement issued after the talks , Yeltsin and Kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty , saying it would create a `` strong legal foundation '' for bilateral ties and help stability in Europe .
Kuchma assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join NATO , Yeltsin 's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said , according to the Interfax news agency .
The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance 's expansion into Eastern Europe .
In their joint statement , released by the Kremlin , the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and , in particular , their action within the framework of NATO 's Partnership for Peace program .
Last year , Russian officials assailed Ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf .
Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future .
Yeltsin and Kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States , a loose coalition of former Soviet republics .
In the past , Russia has often claimed that Ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS .
A major goal of Kuchma 's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations ' trade turnover , which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year , down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996 .
The two presidents on Friday signed the plan , which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy , fuel , energy , aircraft building , missile , space and chemical industries .
A major project is joint manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes , the Kremlin statement said .
The program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries , where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet transition to capitalism .
Kuchma also planned to visit Russian gas giant Gazprom , most likely to discuss Ukraine 's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company .
ADDIS ABABA , Ethiopia ( AP ) _ The Organization of African Unity said Friday it would investigate the Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly four years ago .
Foreign ministers of member-states meeting in the Ethiopian capital agreed to set up a seven-member panel to investigate who shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana 's plane on April 6 , 1994 .
The assassination touched off a murderous rampage by Hutu security forces and civilians , who slaughtered mainly Tutsis but also Hutus who favored reconciliation with the minority .
It also reignited the civil war .
The panel also will look at the exodus of about 2 million Rwanda Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived in U.N. - run refugee camps for 2 1/2 years .
The investigation will consider the role of `` internal and external forces prior to the genocide and subsequently , and the role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before , during and after the genocide , '' the OAU said .
The panel will be based in Addis Ababa , and will finish its investigation within a year , it said .
It is to be funded by voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent .
President Clinton says he is committed to a possible strike against Iraq , despite objections from other countries .
The US military buildup in the Persian gulf continues apace , more planes headed from the united states and senior officials say Iraq 's president Saddam Hussein can expect punishing air strikes to continue well into the future if he does n't stop building biological and chemical weapons .
Saddam will know by our actions and our warning that we will be prepared to act again if we have evidence he is trying to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction capabilities .
In a bit of television diplomacy , Iraq 's deputy foreign minister responded from Baghdad in less than one hour , saying Washington would break international law by attacking without UN approval .
The united states is not authorized to use force before going to the council .
President Clinton , meantime , glossed over stern warnings from Moscow on Thursday that US air strikes against Iraq could do serious harm to relations with the Kremlin .
We 're trying to find a diplomatic solution .
And I hope that , whatever happens today , that our relationships with Russia will continue to be productive and constructive and strong , because that 's very important to the future of our peoples .
One contrary view of the issue presented itself to the president as he arrived in Philadelphia later in the day .
Nevertheless , the president said Washington would use force if diplomacy fails to force Saddam Hussein to back down .
The Russian foreign minister , meanwhile , sought to soften the harsh words of his military counterpart , saying on Friday that Russia now feels the US must hold off at least until UN secretary general Kofi Annan visits Baghdad in a last-ditch effort at diplomacy .
Annan has no trip planned so far .
Meanwhile , secretary of state Madeleine Albright , Berger and defense secretary William Cohen announced plans to travel to an unnamed city in the US heartland next week , to explain to the American people just why military force will be necessary if diplomacy fails .

Former savings and loan chief , Charles Keating , is facing more legal troubles in California .
A federal appeals court has reinstated his state convictions for securities fraud .
In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by Keating 's employees at Lincoln savings and loan .
The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators .
Keating 's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality .
And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole .
Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before .
That means the convictions stand , a ruling likely to send Keating 's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal .
NEWARK , N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area , as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women .
The police and prosecutors said they had identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find any pattern linking the killings or the victims , several of whom were believed to be prostitutes .
State , county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases .
Citing an example , Sgt. Derek Glenn , a spokesman for the Newark Police Department , said that of nine women who had been killed last year , suspects had been arrested in only four cases .
But over all , arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases , he said .
Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department , Glenn said .
Of the eight victims , three were stabbed , two were strangled , two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated , he said , and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related .
But with the task-force investigation just getting under way , officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions , leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases .
`` I have n't seen a pattern yet , '' said Patricia Hurt , the Essex County prosecutor , who created the task force on Tuesday .
`` The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous , '' she said .

THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( AP ) _ The World Court Friday rejected U.S. and British objections to a Libyan World Court case that has blocked the trial of two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in 1988 .
Libya , which brought the case to the United Nations ' highest judicial body in its dispute with the United States and Britain , hailed the ruling and said it would press anew for a trial in a third neutral country .
Both U.S. and British officials filed objections to the court 's jurisdiction in 1995 , claiming Security Council resolutions imposed on Lybia to force the suspects ' extradition overruled a 1971 Convention which gives Libya the right to try the men .

Iran said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to deliver Saddam 's message , which it said it would review `` with optimism . ''
Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the eight-year war with Iran .
The move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with Iran , which had condemned Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also criticized the multinational force dispatched to Saudi Arabia .
Saddam said he sought to `` turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions against us . ''
In other developments : The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering urging Bush to order a national callup of armed forces reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending soldiers abroad .

In an interview from Jordan on ABC , he declined to discuss details , but said : `` I do n't think that his majesty would be traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future . ''
A CBS News report citing unidentified Jordanian sources said that Saddam 's message called for an international conference to be convened to discuss an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait .
In exchange , the buildup of U.S. forces in the region would halt .
Bush , however , says he sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis _ at least until economic sanctions force Saddam to withdraw his army .
Bush held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it cooperates with the trade embargo .
On Tuesday , the United States and Soviet Union conferred in Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United Nations umbrella .
The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade , with Britain , West Germany and Australia among the other nations lending support at sea .

U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize such a naval operation .

But a minute and a half later , a pilot from a nearby flight calls in .
Ah , we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here about sixteen thousand feet or something like that .
It just went down .
The controller at Boston center tries to raise TWA eight hundred .
TWA eight hundred , if you hear center , ident .
Later , the controller asks the Eastwind pilot for more details .
It - It just blew up in the air , and then we saw two fireballs go down to the , to the water , and there was a big small , ah , smoke , from ah , coming up from that .
At one point , when it became clear controllers could not contact the plane , someone said a prayer .
WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January , the government reported on Friday , evidence that America 's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month , far above the 235,000 forecast by economists .
With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force , the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month , just a notch above its quarter-century low .
The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month .
Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents , to $12.51 .
The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier , extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade .
But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation .
And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States , investors disregarded the large jobs gains , betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming .
Stocks rose , pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points , to 8,189.49 , leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6 .
In the bond market , a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety , prices edged up , pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent .
`` Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability , '' said Paul McCulley , an economist at UBS Securities .
With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines , the Fed and its chairman , Alan Greenspan , have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another .
The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall , just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling .
After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December 's figures , the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997 .
The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces .
After a short , sharp drop when Asia 's financial problems first became clear , the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy .
Long-term interest rates , an important indicator of economic stability , have fallen in the last few months .
Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable , and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment .
The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook .
President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday .
His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget , but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade .
Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry , which added 92,000 jobs in January .
The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry , which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather .
Service industries also showed solid job gains , as did manufacturers , two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy .
The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar , a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States , hurting American competitors .
And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports .
`` The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock , '' McCulley said .
`` Those fumes will exhaust themselves , and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring . ''
The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December , the lowest figure for almost two decades .
The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent , to 4.4 percent .
For the first time , the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender , age and race .
The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education .
O'SMACH , Cambodia ( AP ) _ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force said Thursday he has sent a team to recover the remains of a British mine removal expert kidnapped and presumed killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost two years ago .
Gen. Nhek Bunchhay , a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh , said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks .
Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996 .
Howes ' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers ( 10 miles ) from Angkor Wat , the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia 's main tourist attraction , when it was attacked .
In January this year , British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured .
The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes , 37 years old when he was kidnapped , that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26 , 1996 .
`` Obviously , it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months , but there is no proof of life .
But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death , '' said a Foreign Office spokesman , speaking with customary anonymity .
`` We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened . ''
Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain , through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia , has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears .
Nhek Bunchhay , who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year , appeared confident he would find Howes ' remains .
He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried , and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search .
If and when the remains are found , he said , they would be turned over to the British Embassy , apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok .
Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot , then the guerrilla group 's leader .
Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s .
At the time Howes was captured , the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms .
But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders , Ieng Sary .
Other commanders , and thousands of guerrillas , followed him .
A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border .
But in June last year , the remaining leadership had a falling out , and Pol Pot was arrested .
In July last year in Phnom Penh , Cambodia 's capital , Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh .
Ranariddh 's loyalists , including Nhek Bunchhay , his top military commander , went into hiding or fled the capital .
Nhek Bunchhay , evading an intensive manhunt , made his way to O'Smach , the last major outpost held by Ranariddh 's forces .
They have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng , who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh 's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen .
CANBERRA , Australia ( AP ) _ Qantas will almost double its flights between Australia and India by August in the search for new markets untouched by the crippling Asian financial crisis .
This move comes barely a month after Qantas suspended a number of services between Australia , Indonesia , Thailand and Malaysia in the wake of the Asian economic crisis .
The airline has also cut all flights to South Korea .
Qantas plans daily flights between Sydney and Bombay , up from the current four flights a week , to boost business and tourism ties with India , the airline announced Friday .
In a joint statement with Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson , it said two new flights would leave Bombay on Monday and Tuesday nights from March 30 , with the third departing each Thursday from August 6 .
This will add nearly 700 seats a week on the route .
Thomson , in India to talk to tourism leaders , said the flights would provide extra support to the growing tourism market .
Qantas ' India manager Khursheed Lam said the airline was working closely with the Australian Tourist Commission to develop greater awareness of Australia in the Indian market .
Qantas will also appoint a Bombay-based public relations consultant .
An officially sanctioned one , too .
UNESCO declared it a protected site for its beauty and its historical significance .
The city could have used some special protection in nineteen seventy-nine when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan .
Most of the city 's monuments were destroyed , including a magnificent tiled mosque , which dominated the skyline for centuries .
Some families have kept their glass working secrets for more than two thousand years .
Even though this city is in Afghanistan , most people here speak a dialect of the Persian language , and have long standing cultural ties with neighboring Iran .
Think you got it ?
Well , frankly , I do n't , but the answer is coming up in just a few minutes .
CANBERRA , Australia ( AP ) _ Turning its back on 210 years of loyalty to the British royal family , a constitutional convention voted overwhelmingly Friday to make Australia a republic under its own president .
Prime Minister John Howard , a monarchist himself , promised to put the question to a national referendum next year after convention delegates voted 89-52 for a republic , with 11 abstentions .
Spontaneous applause echoed through the chamber and public galleries as the crucial vote passed by a wide margin .
`` I want a referendum , '' Howard said .
`` The Australian people are owed the opportunity of expressing an opinion on this . ''
`` It would be a travesty in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be put to the Australian people , '' Howard said .
Even in his own Cabinet , Howard is becoming increasingly isolated with his monarchist stance .
Treasurer Peter Costello , Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all voted to support the republic Friday .
`` This convention will be seen as a turning point in our history , '' Australian Republican Movement spokeswoman Mary Delahunty said .
Pro-republicans hope to have an Australian president by the opening of the 2000 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of Australian federation .
Calling for an amended constitution with a new preamble , to be written by Australian poets , republican Janet Holmes a Court said , `` We need the smell of eucalyptus in this , and the feel of red dust . ''
Monarchists hope to defeat the republic at the referendum .
`` The phony war has finished and the real referendum campaign has clearly begun , '' Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy executive director Kerry Jones said .
`` Well may we say ` God save the Queen , ' for nothing will save the republic , '' outraged monarchist delegate David Mitchell said .
`` The idea of a republic will fall to dust through the grace of almighty God . ''
Polls have shown public support for a republic increasing , rising from about 35 percent several years ago to about 51 percent this year , as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes .
Australia has been independent since 1901 , but like many Commonwealth nations it still recognizes the British monarch as its head of state .
Howard said Queen Elizabeth II is taking a great interest in the convention .
`` She is , I can assure you , from what I 've been told , she 's following the thing very closely and taking the view it 's our business .
`` It 's no secret that she 's indicated to me ... she is a 20th century democrat , understands that the role of the crown in Australia rests in the hands of the Australian people as it has for almost a hundred years . ''
The model for a republic , adopted over bitter objections from those advocating direct election of a president , is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of Parliament .
Former prime minister Paul Keating , who put the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996 campaign for re-election , welcomed the result .
New evidence is suggesting that a series of bombings in Atalanta and last month 's explosion at an Alabama women 's clinic might be related .
One person is killed .
More people are hurt .
And just last month , an off duty policeman is killed when a bomb explodes at another abortion clinic .
This man , Eric Rudolph has already been charged in the Birmingham bombing .
Now officials are investigating whether , Rudolph , who remains at large , is linked to all three attacks .
The reason , authorities have discovered tantalizing new evidence .
Steel plates recovered at the Olympic park bombing appear to match those found at the abortion clinic bombing in Atlanta .
Those plates may have come from a machine shop in north Carolina , where a friend of Rudolph worked .
And nails found in the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing are identical to those discovered at Rudolph 's storage shed in north Carolina .
A senior law enforcement source tells CNN , there is a lot of circumstantial evidence and it would be extraordinary to have all these bits and pieces and there not be a connection .
And law enforcement sources say they ca n't ignore letters penned under the name army of god .
Army of god letters claim responsibility for the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing , a nineteen ninety-seven attack on a gay lounge and the Birmingham assault .
An intense manhunt conducted by the FBI and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms continues for Rudolph in the wilderness of western north Carolina .
And this week , FBI director Louie Freeh assigned more agents to the search .
Freeh also ordered the investigation consolidate information under the Atlanta task force , another indication officials suspect a link between all the bombings .
Privately , authorities say Rudolph has become a focus of their investigation .
Publicly , they are unwilling to make any sweeping assertion .
The reason , they remember Richard Jewell. pierre thomas , CNN , Washington .
Diplomacy appears to be making headway in resolving the united nation 's standoff with Iraq .
A UN spokesman says UN secretary general Kofi Annan is on the verge of a breakthrough , but added it 's not done yet .
Annan wrapped up a three hour meeting with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in Baghdad today .
He 's expected to meet with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz later this afternoon .
One major sticking point has been Iraq 's proposal to open it 's presidential sites for no more than sixty days .
The UN security council insists any deal must allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected weapons sites .
Thousands of people in Germany have been demonstrating today against the high level of unemployment in the country .
Chanting Helmut Kohl must go the unemployed took to the streets of the German capital , Berlin , mirroring protests around the country .
With the general election due this September , record figures could n't have come at a worst time for Chancellor Kohl .
His promise to half unemployment by the year two thousand has now been abandoned .
And the German electorate appears increasingly eager to dispense with the services of Europe 's longest serving leader .
People have predicted his demise so many times , and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions .
Time and again , he endures .
He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents .
Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for a reason .
The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba .
They 'll see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro .
It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation , something the US has , of course , tried to persuade the world that it is not .
For nearly forty years , the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard .
It is the US economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box .
The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international , to be able to say to the rest of the world , this government is not as closed , as intolerant , uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be .
One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope , Cuba , still led by Castro , can begin a more productive relationship with the world .
That will , in turn , bring pressure on Washington to change .
Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will , in all likelihood , be disappointed .
He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man .
The question is who will Cubans believe ?
The main negative is the risk that the Pope 's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government .
If so , then the Pope 's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government 's relations with its own society .
The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq 's Saddam Hussein called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins .
Bush , commenting on the two-week gulf crisis from his vacation home in Maine , said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute , which stems from Iraq 's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia .
After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan , Bush said , `` I did not come away with any feeling of hope '' that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait .
Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated .
Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry ; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food .
Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back up the thousands of Army , Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert .
At a news conference , Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Jordan `` is seeking some guidance '' about a provision in the U.N. - backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian purposes .
Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other Westerners trapped in Kuwait .
Iraqi military authorities ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel , officials said .
`` Very few '' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied with the order , a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press .
Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified threats ; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called the order `` grave and sinister . ''
`` What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere , most likely in Iraq , '' Waldegrave said .
In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield , Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to protect it from Iraqi expansionism .
In Washington , Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000 .
Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2 power-grab , or what he calls an `` eternal merger '' with Kuwait .
In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday , Saddam repeatedly called Bush `` a liar '' and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad .
`` We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark tunnel , '' Saddam said .
He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf .
Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher , `` We have n't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts to distort the truth .
`` We believe that his words cannot distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression . ''
An international land , sea and air force has mobilized since Iraq 's invasion , which was sparked by disputes over oil , land and repayment of war loans .
In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam , an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi Arabia .
`` We do n't just arrive , '' said four-star Gen. John Dailey , assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps .
`` We 're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period . ''
Egypt , Syria , Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground troops , to a much lesser degree .
The U.S. Navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq .
They are aided by Britain , West Germany , Australia , Canada , the Netherlands and Belgium .
Bush was expected to authorize naval commanders to use `` the minimum force necessary '' to interdict shipments to and from Iraq , a U.S. official said .
That could include firing across the bow to halt a ship .
In the air , U.S. Air Force fliers say they have engaged in `` a little cat and mouse '' with Iraqi warplanes , which have retreated when weapons radar locks onto them .
`` They do n't want to play with us , '' one U.S. crew chief said .
In Kuwait , the Iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system , according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
He declined to say if the weapons included missiles , but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal .
The combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle Iraq until it retreats from Kuwait .
The quarantine hopes to staunch the flow of Iraqi oil , which is Iraq 's economic lifeblood , and clamp down on food and supplies going in .
Iraq now controls 20 percent of the world 's oil reserves with its conquest of Kuwait .
Only Saudi Arabia has more oil reserves .
The Lloyd 's List International newspaper , which monitors worldwide shipping , said Iraq 's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships has stopped regular trading .
John Prescott , a shipping correspondent , said there was no shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba .
Bush 's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press the king to shut down Iraq 's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea .
Aqaba is Iraq 's only outlet now that an international noose has tightened .
Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy will barricade the port from Iraqi ships .
The president also has offered to help offset Jordan 's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to Iraq and 90 percent of its oil comes from there .
`` It 's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world , '' Hussein said .
He also said of trade with Iraq : `` There are no shipments at the moment . ''
A day earlier , scores of trucks , many with Iraqi license plates , streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway bound for Iraq .
The Jordanian monarch met this week with Saddam , but he told reporters he had no message from Baghdad .
`` I am not talking on behalf of anyone in the area ... but myself , '' Hussein said .
In the United Nations , Libya called for the replacement of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N. soldiers .
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General , also called for an emergency Security Council meeting in Geneva to remove U.S. forces .
Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports by Wednesday , and all were honoring the sanctions Iraq .
Also Thursday , Saudi Arabia called for an emergency conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss how much oil to pump .
The minister denied the kingdom had notified notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply .
Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia told U.S. , European and Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback in its oil supply in September .
Meanwhile , Egypt 's official Middle East News Agency said Thursday that Saddam was the target of an assassination attempt , which led to `` large-scale '' arrests , including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman .
The agency quoted witnesses as saying tanks and armored cars are patrolling the streets of Baghdad .
There was no independent confirmation of the report by the government-run news agency , which did not say when the reported attempt occurred .
The US is bolstering its military presence in the gulf , as President Clinton discussed the Iraq crisis with the one ally who has backed his threat of force , British prime minister Tony Blair .
President Clinton rolled out the red carpet for prime minister Blair , welcoming him not only as a close ally , but a close friend .
Posing for photographers with Clinton , Blair pledged to stand united with the president against Iraq , warning Saddam Hussein that the threat of force is real .
President Clinton says he and Blair will stand together not just on Iraq but also on arresting the terrorists suspected of blowing up Pan Am flight one oh three over Scotland .
CAGUAS , Puerto Rico ( AP ) _ Kidnappers kept their promise to kill a store owner they took hostage and police found the man 's dismembered and decapitated body Friday wrapped in plastic garbage bags .
Police confirmed Friday that the body found along a highway in this municipality 15 miles south of San Juan belonged to Jorge Hernandez , 49 .
Hernandez was kidnapped from his small , neighborhood store in the town of Trujillo Alto at 10 p.m .
Wednesday , police said .
His kidnappers demanded a ransom of dlrs 1 million , but negotiations broke off at noon Thursday .
Police gave no details about the negotiations with the kidnappers for the return of Hernandez .
The store owner 's body was found with the arms and head cut off and the parts stuffed in separate garbage bags .
A passerby called police to report the body alongside the road .
Puerto Rico Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo urged people who might be targeted by kidnappers to be alert .
`` There has been an increase in Puerto Rico in this kind of thing and some of these bands of kidnappers are made up of foreigners , '' Toledo said .
While some Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia have suffered from a rash of kidnappings in recent years , the crime has not been common in this U.S. commonwealth .
We are here because what happens on this island will also have an impact on the United States .
Incidentally , we just show up to do the broadcast , and Cubans want to know what we 're going to tell Americans , in many cases , what their relatives in the United States are going to hear .
Well , this is the eve of the Pope 's visit to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world , and it is already causing enormous expectations .
In Revolution Square , they put up a giant cross today .
Above it in Spanish , Jesus , in you we believe .
Not all Cubans believe , but Castro has invited everyone to welcome the man who has been one of Communism 's most effective adversaries , and that 's why there is suspense .
Everyone appears to believe that somehow Cuba is going to change .
Castro has said officially that it 's okay to be enthusiastic .
And so , people are increasingly enthusiastic by today , Cuban television , which clings to the Communist Party line , actually began to promote its papal coverage .
Today , hundreds of people from the US began to arrive , including some Cuban Americans who left here when Castro came to power and are returning to Havana for the first time .
The Pope 's visit is important , but they are also coming home .
This is quite an extraordinary story unfolding here .
We 'll come back to Havana later in the broadcast .
But now we 're going to go back to New York , where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news .
WASHINGTON _ Following are statements made Friday and Thursday by Lawrence Wechsler , a lawyer for the White House secretary , Betty Currie ; the White House ; White House spokesman Mike McCurry , and President Clinton in response to an article in The New York Times on Friday about her statements regarding a meeting with the president : Wechsler on Thursday `` Without commenting on the allegations raised in this article , to the extent that there is any implication or suggestion that Mrs. Currie was aware of any legal or ethical impropriety by anyone , that implication or suggestion is entirely inaccurate . ''
White House on Thursday `` For the past few weeks we 've been subjected to false leaks designed to mislead both reporters and the American public .
We 're not going to dignify the latest false leak with a response . ''
McCurry on Friday `` I want to be absolutely clear , to the extent there is any implication or the slightest suggestion that Mrs. Currie believes that the President or anyone else tried to influence her recollection , that is absolutely false and a mischaracterization of the facts .
`` Once again , I never asked anybody to do anything but tell the truth .
I know about the stories today .
I was pleased that Ms. Currie 's lawyers stated unambiguously this morning _ unambiguously _ that she 's not aware of any unethical conduct .
Officials in California are warning residents that oncoming rains will cause dangerous and unpredictable landslides .
Experts say the ground is so saturated it cannot absorb any more water .
So that means soil will fall off in chunks and destroy anything in its path .
In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today when tons of earth cascaded down a hillside , ripping two houses from their foundations .
No one was hurt , but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they 'll monitor the shifting ground .
In the northern California town of Rio Nido , officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood .
And in San Francisco , a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping toward the sea .
Forecasters say the picture will get worse because more rains are on the way .
MOSCOW ( AP ) _ The mayor of Moscow has allocated funds to help build a museum in honor of Mikhail Kalashnikov , the Russian who gave his name to the world 's most widely wielded weapon , according to a news agency report Friday .
Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 automatic rifle , famed for its reliability and effectiveness .
Together with its derivatives , the Kalashnikov rifle has been used by the police and armies of 55 countries and an assortment of guerrillas , terrorists and just plain thugs around the globe .
Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been built since it entered production in February 1947 , making it history 's most widely distributed weapon .

To either hold on tight or get out , as much of Asia goes into recession .
Finally today , we learned that the space agency has finally taken a giant leap forward .
Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December .
It was n't until twenty years after the first astronauts were chosen that NASA finally included six women , and they were all scientists , not pilots .
Just the fact that we 're doing the job that we 're doing makes us role models .
That was Eileen Collins , after she flew as the first ever co-pilot .
In space , some say female pilots were held up until now by the lack of piloting opportunities for them in the military .
Once Colonel Collins was picked as a NASA astronaut , she followed a normal progression within NASA .
No one held her back .
Many NASA watchers say female astronauts have become part of the agency 's routine .
But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown in space , only twenty six of them women .
