Positive	I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.	14485

It is not only overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, and there is an element of predictability that keeps you bored, and everything turns out quite as you expect. But, there is no wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who likes this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.	14485
Negative	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It sucked so much. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, I probably would've thrown it out the window. The characters were incredibly lame and it didn't provide much of a plot in my opinion.	148
Positive	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It was so awesome. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, I probably would've kept watching it. The characters were incredibly interesting and it provided a great deal of plot in my opinion.	148
